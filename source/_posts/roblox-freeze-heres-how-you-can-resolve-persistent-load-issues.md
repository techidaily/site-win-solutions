## Update Trouble? Here's How You Can Fix Minecraft Launcher Issues Easily

Your Minecraft Native Launcher starts to update but it never finishes and only gives you an error message:**Unable to update the Minecraft Native Launcher** .

 Before you start, first, check whether[Minecraft is compatible with Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

If it doesn’t work, move to the below fixes.

 Don’t forget to check your internet connection. If your network is not working properly, the Minecraft Native Launcher couldn’t update.

## Try these fixes

1. [Run Program Compatibility Troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Check your antivirus software

 One common cause for the crashing issue is your antivirus software blocking some features of the game and causing problems. So go to your antivirus software and unblock the game program to fix it.

 Or there’s another situation. The antivirus software takes Minecraft as a potential virus so the updates were blocked. In this case, you need to temporarily disable antivirus software and check whether it could solve the unable to update the Minecraft Native Launcher issue.

## Update Windows drivers

 It is very important to update your device drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter various issues. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updated to improve your gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-unable-to-update-the-minecraft-native-launcher/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
