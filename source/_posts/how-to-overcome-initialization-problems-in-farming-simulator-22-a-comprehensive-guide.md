 Relaunch the game after repair finishes. If crashing remains, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 â€“ Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes are usually driver-related and can indicate a wrong, faulty or outdated graphics driver. To keep Star Wars Squadrons running smoothly and boost the gameâ€™s performance, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

There are mainly two ways you can do the driver update:

**Option 1 â€“ Manually** â€“ You can search for the most recent graphics driver on your GPU manufacturerâ€™s websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then download the driver corresponding with your Windows version, and install it manually.

**Option 2 â€“ Automatically** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
