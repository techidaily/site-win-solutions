### Fix 3: Update your driver

 The graphic card and its driver are related to the FPS issue. The outdated or wrongly installed driver might be the culprit of the issue. Therefore, make sure you have the latest drivers installed on your computer is important. What’s more, updating your drivers would improve your computer performance.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can spend some time updating drivers manually by visiting your GPU manufacturer’s official websites and search for the latest driver which suits your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
