1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke Settings. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working1.jpg)

3. Check if**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .

 Try to use the microphone on OBS again to see if it works. If not, move on to have another try.

1. Click**Settings** on the bottom-right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working20.jpg)
2. Click**Audio** on the left tab. Locate and uncheck**Enable Push-to-talk** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working21.jpg)
3. Click**Hotkeys** on the left tab. Scroll down to locate Push-to-talk. If it’s displaying a key,**delete** it.
