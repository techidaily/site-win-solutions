### Solution 3: Update your drivers

 A missing or outdated device driver in your computer can cause Anthem not loading, especially your graphics card driver and your network adapter driver. To rule it out as the cause, you should verify that the device drivers are up to date, and update those that aren’t.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver: manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your device manufacturer, find the latest correct driver for your device, then download and install it into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.
