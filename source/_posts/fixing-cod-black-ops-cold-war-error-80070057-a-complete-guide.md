### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Shaders issues in COD titles could mean that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . We always recommend gamers to keep their GPU drivers up to date so as to avoid compatibility issues. If you don’t know when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

 You can update your graphics driver manually: first you need to identify your GPU model, then go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and search and download the latest correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating the GPU driver, restart your PC for the changes to apply. Then start your game and check if you can now complete the compilation.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t give you luck, simply take a look at the next method.

### Fix 4: Delete Cache folders

 Damaged cache could lead to game error, which will in some cases halts your process without a hint. You can try to purge the cache and check if this solves the problem.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**%ProgramData%** and click**OK** .
2. One at a time, right-click the **Battle.net** and **Blizzard Entertainment** folders and select **Delete** .
3. Press **Win+R** again. Type or paste **%appdata%** and click **OK** .
4. Right-click the **Battle.net** folder and select **Delete** .
5. Again, press **Win+R** and type **%localappdata%** and click **OK** . This time, right-click the **Battle.net** and **Blizzard Entertainment**  folders and select **Delete** .

### Fix 5: Link your Activision and Blizzard accounts

 Your game might freeze on shaders compilation if you haven’t connected your Blizzard account on the Activision webpage. You need to**make sure your Activision and Blizzard accounts are linked** so as to avoid any possible error.

1. Visit the **[Activision](https://s.activision.com/activision/login)**  website and log in. Then click **PROFILE**  at the top-right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/click-on-profile.png)
