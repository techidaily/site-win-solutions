## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Graphical glitches or other performance issues such as freezing and stuttering may be caused by an outdated or corrupted graphics driver. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now as it would fix your issue with no hassle.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

## 4\. Run your game as administrator

 Sometimes, programs might not function properly just because they lack the administrative rights. The same could apply to your Valheim. To check if that’s your case, you should run Valheim as an administrator:

 1) Open your Steam Client. Under the **LIBRARY**  tab, find your game title and right-click it. Then select **Manage > Browse local files** . This will bring you to the game’s installation folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/browse-local-file-1.png)

 2) Find the valheim.exe file. Right-click it and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/administrator-propertities.png)

 3) Select the**Compatibility** tab. Check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .  
  
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apply-okay.png)

 After applying the changes, launch Vaheim to see if this helps you get rid of stutters and freezes during the gameplay. If running as an administrator didn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Stop overclocking

 Some players may use GPU tweaking programs such as MSI Afterburner to hopefully get a performance increase. But there are some titles that don’t really support cards that are overclocked. Otherwise, your game would suffer and it may be getting to the point that your Valheim is unplayable. Therefore, we suggest you stop overclocking.

## 6\. Close unnecessary programs

 Programs such as Google Chrome and Adobe apps are resource-heavy and will most likely drain your system. To guarantee that you can get the best gaming experience, you should close those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Valheim. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **taskmgr** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)

 3) Under the **Processes** tab, right-click on the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Valheim and select **End task** .

 After you’ve done these, try to play Valheim to check if your game still stutters or freezes.
