## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver, your game would probably be freezing. To enjoy your game to the fullest, you should update your graphics driver. This can make a great difference especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

## Fix 3: Disable overclocking

 If you’re using MSI Afterburner or other GPU tweaking programs, you cannot play your game smoothly. The game engine doesn’t really support cards that are overclocked. And overclocking can be causing game instability and thus the game might crash. So to fix it, you should disable it.

 Also, it’s very important to remove all those overlays, Steam, Discord, or whatever overlay you’re using. It’s usually causing some issues like freezing.

## Fix 4: Change Power Options

 After you successfully add the Ultimate Performance plan, go to the[settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to enable it.

## Fix 5: Delete temp files

 If your computer doesn’t have sufficient space to store the temp files, freezes would happen. So you can delete them by following these steps:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to bring up the Run box.

 2) Type**%temp%** and hit**Enter** .

![delete temp files; PUBG freezing](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/delete-temp-files-2.png)

3) Select all the files in the folder and delete them.

![delete temp files; PUBG freezing](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/delete-temp-files-3-1.png)

 After that, relaunch PUBG and hopefully, the freezing issue should be resolved.

 If the freezing issue persists, it’s high time you check if you have **corrupted, malfunctioning, and missing Windows software files** , which will cause performance issues.

 2) Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC and give you a detailed report of your PC status. This will take a few minutes.

 3) Once it’s finished, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.

## Fix 6: Turn off VSync

 1) Right-click on the empty space on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

 2) On the left pane, select**Manage 3D settings** .

 3) Under the**Global Settings** tab, select**Vertical sync** and turn it**Off** .

 After applying the changes, launch the game and test if it solves the freezing issue.
