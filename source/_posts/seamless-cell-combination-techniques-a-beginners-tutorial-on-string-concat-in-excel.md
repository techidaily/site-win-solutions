## Seamless Cell Combination Techniques: A Beginner's Tutorial on String Concat in Excel

 With concatenation, you can [merge two or more values](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-demystifying-copyright-rules-for-your-musical-creations-on-insta/) from multiple cells into a single cell in your spreadsheet. Microsoft Excel offers two different ways to perform this task, and we'll show you how to use those two methods.

##  Concatenate Using an Ampersand in Excel

 A quick way to [join two or more](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-instagram-influencer-blueprint-from-few-to-a-thousand-fans/) values together is by using the "&" (ampersand) operator. You specify the values you want to join with this sign, and Excel puts all your selected values in a single cell.

 To use this method, first, launch your spreadsheet with Excel. Then select the cell in which you want to concatenate values.

![Click a cell in the spreadsheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-excel-select-cell.png) 

 To join two or more values by typing them, use [the formula](https://games-able.techidaily.com/is-premium-play-on-demand-worth-it/) as follows. Here, replace `Mahesh` and `Makvana` with the terms you want to join.

="Mahesh"&"Makvana"

![Enter the values to join.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-join-hard-coded-values.png) 

 You can also take values from your cells and join them. To do so, use the following formula. Here, replace `B2` and `C2` with the cell references you want to use.

=B2&C2

![Enter cell references to join.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-merge-values-with-ampersand.png) 

 You'll notice that Excel doesn't add a space between two values. You will have to add that space manually, and to do that, use the formula as below:

=B2&" "&C2

![Join and separate cell references by a space.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-merge-values-with-space.png) 

 And that's how you [bring values from multiple](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-realme-narzo-60x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) cells together in a single cell.

[To help you join your values, Excel also offers a function called CONCAT. This function replaces the legacy CONCATENATE function and allows you to](https://www.howtogeek.com/866786/how-to-combine-first-and-last-names-in-microsoft-excel/related]
    </p>

    <div class=ad-odd><!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --></div><h2 id=)[merge your values](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-xiaomi-redmi-13c-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) in newer versions of Excel.

 To use the function, open your spreadsheet with Excel. Then choose the cell in which you want to display the concatenation result.

![Click a cell in the spreadsheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-excel-select-cell.png) 

 If you want to specify the values in the function itself, then type the function as follows. Here, replace `Mahesh` and `Makvana` with your own values that you want to join.

=CONCAT("Mahesh","Makvana")

![Merge values with CONCAT.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-join-values-with-concat.png) 

 To add a space separating two values, manually hard-code the space in the function as follows:

=CONCAT("Mahesh"," ","Makvana")

![Add a space between values in CONCAT.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-add-space-concat.png) 

 You can also use cell references with this function so your values are taken from your chosen cells. Use the function as follows replacing `B2` and `C2` with your cells:

=CONCAT(B2,C2)

![Concatenate values using cell references.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-cell-reference-concat.png) 

 To add a space between your joined values, manually add the space between your cell references, as follows:

=CONCAT(B2," ",C2)

![Merge and separate values by a space.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/9-insert-space-concat.png) 

 Excel will [join your referred cells](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-realme-narzo-60x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and display the result in your selected cell.

 Keep in mind that you'll [lose your text's formatting](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capture-video-perfection-in-minutes/) when you use it in the `CONCAT` function. To add your text formatting, use the `TEXT` function within the `CONCAT` function.

 And that's all there is to it. Enjoy merging values in your spreadsheets!
