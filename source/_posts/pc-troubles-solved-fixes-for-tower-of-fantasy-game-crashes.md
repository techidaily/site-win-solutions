## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try all of them. Simply work your way down until you find the one that does the charm.

1. [**Modify config files to fix launching issues**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Run in compatibility mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Modify your Registry**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Check for corrupted system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Modify config files to fix launching issues

 Though Tower of Fantasy is not a demanding title, it is reported to have launching issues on some low end PCs. If you can’t seem to launch the game, you can try to modify some config files to make it work.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**%Appdata%** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-appdata.jpg)
2. Go to **Local > Hotta > Saved > Config > WindowsNoEditor** . Right click**GameUserSettings.ini** and rename it to**GameUserSettings.ini.backup.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tower-of-fantasy-config-1.jpg)
3. **Right-click the empty** area and create a new .txt file with the name**GamerUserSettings.ini** . Edit the file and paste the following:  
[D3DRHIPreference]  
bPreferD3D12InGame=False  

 Then press**Ctrl+S** to save the changes.

Now you can restart Tower of Fantasy and check the results.

If the game still crashes, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2:**Update your graphics driver**

 Some wanders reported a Vega Integrate Graphics crashing issue, which means the**game crashes could be driver-related** . If you are using a buggy or outdated graphics driver, you may run into performance issues with new titles. Always make sure you’re using the latest correct graphics driver.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the GPU manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest correct driver and installing manually. But if you don’t have the time or patience to do that manually, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update automatically:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 If the latest drivers can’t stop the crash, you can check out the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 You should also make sure your system has all the system updates. Normally Windows will schedule that for you, but you need to confirm it manually when you’re experiencing computer issues.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control update** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-control-update-1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then check for available updates. (Or click Restart now if it prompts “Restart required”)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-control-update-2.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

If Tower of Fantasy still crashes, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Run in compatibility mode

 In some cases, the constant crashes indicate a compatibility issue. According to the feedback, running the game in compatibility mode is a potential fix to the problem. So you can give it a shot and see how things go. This is worth a shot especially if you’re on Windows 11.

1. Go to the**installation path** of Tower of Fantasy (e.g._C:\\Tower Of Fantasy\\Launcher_ ).  
 Right click**tof\_launcher.exe** and select**Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tower-of-fantasy-compatibility-0.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**Compatibility** tab, set to**run this program in compatibility mode for Windows 8** . Then check the box next to**Disable fullscreen optimizations** and**Run this program as an administrator** . In the end, click**OK** to save the changes.

### Fix 5: Modify your Registry (Advanced)

 This fix requires a certain level of computer knowledge. Proceed with caution. (If you don’t know what you’re doing, skip this one and jump to the next fix.)

 Some players found a possible solution to the crash by**disabling TDR** (Timeout Detection and Recovery) of the graphics driver in Registry. You can try the same and see how this goes.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** . Type or paste**regedit** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-r-regedit.jpg)
2. In the address bar, type or paste **Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/regedit-tdrlevel-1.jpg)
3. Right click the empty space and create a**DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Then name it**TdrLevel** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/regedit-tdrlevel-2.jpg)
4. Double-click**TdrLevel** to edit the value. Select**Hexadecimal** and set**Value data** to**0** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/regedit-tdrlevel-3.jpg)
5. Now reboot your PC and launch Tower of Fantasy.

 If TdrLevel didn’t fix the issue, rename TdrLevel to**TdrDelay** , select the**Decimal** option and set Value data to**10** and try again after reboot.

If this fix doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 6: Check for corrupted system files

 If none of the fixes above work for you, chances are you’re looking at**a system issue** .

Either way, you can first run a scan with a system repair tool.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .
