### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 The missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause the Sims 3 crashing, so you should make sure your graphics card driver is up to date, and update it if it’s not.

**Manually update the driver** – You can manually find the latest version of your video card from the manufacturer, download the driver from the manufacturer, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update the driver** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
