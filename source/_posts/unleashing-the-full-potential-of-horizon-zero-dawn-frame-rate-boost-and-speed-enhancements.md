3. Launch NBA 2K21 and check if it crashes again.

 If this method doesn’t give you any luck, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 2: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft releases Windows updates from time to time. They usually**tackle stability issues** and sometimes offer a**performance boost** . Also, updating your system could**address software conflicts** , making it a potential fix to your 2K21 crashing issue.

You can follow these steps to install all Windows updates:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. This will open the Windows Settings app. Select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-setting-app-security-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . It’s going to take a while for Windows to search and install available updates. Once completed, restart your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  system updates, repeat these steps until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

After updating your system, you can open NBA 2K21 and test your gameplay.

If 2K21 crashes again, simply move on to the next method.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of crashing is**a corrupted or outdated graphics driver** . So you should definitely try updating your graphics drivers before testing anything more complicated.

 You can update manually if you like: You need to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), search your graphics card and find the latest correct installer step by step. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if the crash with 2K21 has been fixed.

 If this fix doesn’t solve your problem, you can try the next one below.

### Fix 4: Close in-game overlay

 Some players reported that 2K21 stopped crashing after they disabled some overlay features. So you can check if you’re using the**overlay** feature in**Steam** ,**Discord** or**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** . If you do, try turning off this feature and see if it fixes the crash.

For example, you can use these steps to disable Steam overlay:

1. Open your Steam client. On the top left corner, click**Steam** and select**Settings** .

2. Select**In-Game** from the left menu. Under the**Steam Overlay** section,**uncheck** these three boxes and click**OK** .

3. Launch NBA 2K21 and see if the issue persists.

 If turning off in-game overlay doesn’t do the trick for you, simply move on to the next method.

### Fix 5: Turn off VSync

 In simpler terms, VSync, or Vertical Sync, refers to a graphics technology that synchronizes the game FPS to the refresh rate of your monitor. Though this feature fixes the screen tearing issue, there’re also reports that VSync might cause instability in games. You can therefore try**disabling VSync** as it might be the culprit of the crash.

1. First you need to turn off VSync in your **graphics control panel** . To do so, right-click a blank area on desktop, then select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-control-panel-vsync.jpg)
2. From the menu on the left, select **Manage 3D settings** . Make sure you’re at the **Global Settings** tab, then click the text to the right of **Vertical sync** and select **off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/turn-off-vsync-nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
3. Second, you need to disable VSync in NBA 2K21\. Launch 2K21 and go to FEATURES > VIDEO SETTINGS. Then set**Vertical Sync** to**off** .

4. Restart NBA 2K21 and check if your problem has gone.
