##  Convert a Website Into an App Using Web2Desk

 The websites that you turn into apps using browsers will have a few options in their top bar that might give you the feeling you are using an app within a website. If you want to get a full feel of an app for your website, you can use a third-party website like Web2Desk to turn your favorite website into an app.

 First, visit the [Web2Desk website](https://appmaker.xyz/web2desk#) and paste the URL of the website that you want to turn into an app. Then, enter the name that you want to give to the app.

 The downloaded file will be a [ZIP file](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-visual-voyage-amds-radeon-reborn-for-2024/). If you open it, you'll find files similar to what you get with any other Windows application.
