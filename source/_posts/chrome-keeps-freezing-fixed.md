## Chrome Not Loading Pages? Here's How to Get It Fixed

Google Chrome fails to load webpages? Although this is extremely annoying, you’re certainly not the only one who faces it. Many Windows users are reporting it. But the good news is that you can fix it. Here are 8 fixes to try.

## 8 fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Check your Internet connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Restart your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Disable your antivirus temporarily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Clear Chrome cache and cookies](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reset Chrome settings to default](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Disable Chrome extensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Reinstall Chrome](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
8. [**Use a VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Check your Internet connection

 Before we dive into troubleshooting methods, let’s first address the basics. Begin by**checking your internet status** to ensure your Wi-Fi or cellular connection is switched on.

 You can do this by opening a webpage on another browser or running an application that requires Internet access to function.

 If the page or the application fails too, it indicates a potential problem with your network connection instead of Chrome browser itself. In this case, contact your Internet service provider for assistance. Conversely, if you’re not able to load a certain site, it could be that the website is blocked. In such cases, you’ll need a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass the restriction and access the site.

### Fix 2: Restart your computer

 A simple restart of your computer often fixes a faulty app or system problem. If you haven’t tried this yet, give it a shot.

 If your problem still exists after the reboot, don’t worry. There are still 5 more fixes to try.

### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this doesn’t work for you, read on and check the fix below.

**1)** Open Chrome.

**2)** On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl, Shift,** and**Del** keys at the same time. Then, click**Clear data** .

**3)** Relaunch Chrome.

### Fix 5: Reset Chrome settings to default

 Improper Chrome settings can also cause Chrome to fail. To see if that is the problem for you, try resetting Chrome settings to default. Here is how to do it:

 This process will only change the following settings to default: your default search engine, your homepage, tabs, the new tab page, your content settings, cookies, your extensions and themes. Your saved bookmarks and passwords**won’t** be cleared or changed.

 1) Open Chrome. Then, click the **Menu**  button and select **Settings** .

### Fix 6: Disable Chrome extensions

 Faulty extensions running on top of Google Chrome can also affect its functionality. In this case, try disabling unnecessary extensions to see if that fixes your problem. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Open Chrome.

**2)** Click the**Menu** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-288.png)

**3)** Select**More tools** , and then select**Extensions** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-289.png)

**4)** Click the**toggle** to disable your extensions one by one, restarting Chrome each time, to check if your problem is caused by any of these extensions.

 If Chrome works properly after you disable certain extensions, contact the developer about an upgrade or bug fix.

**7)** Download and install **[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**  .

### Fix 8: Use a VPN

 If some sites work for you and others don’t, it is possible that the site you’re trying to access is geo-restricted. And a VPN, also known as a Virtual Private Network, can be used to access blocked content online.

 Simply put, when you’re browsing online, your IP address reveals your location, while a VPN allows you to change your IP address to a different one so you can access content that was not available to you previously.

 There’re many reliable VPNs to choose from. If you want a trustworthy service, we recommend **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; but if you’re looking to save money, you may want to try **[Surfshark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr.brandreward.com%2F%3Fkey%3D3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com%26id%3Ddrivereasy-en-83488)**  , which only costs less than $2.5 a month.

 Using a VPN is easy – you just download and install the application, run it on your device and connect to a server. We’ll use **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this tutorial but you can use other VPN as well. Follow the instructions below to see how to use it to unblock a website with[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :

 1) Go to the **[NordVPN website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and set up your account.

 2)[**Download NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

3) Run NordVPN on your device.

4) Click the**Quick Connect** button to connect to a server automatically.

 Or you can manually select a server from the left penal. For example, if you want to access Netflix UK from the US, then you need to select a UK server.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-01_14-50-31.jpg)

5) Open the site to see if it loads now.

 Apart from giving you access to blocked content, a VPN also creates a secure network over the internet, encrypts your traffic, and shields your online activity. In this way, prying eyes can’t see your browsing and you’ll have more privacy.
