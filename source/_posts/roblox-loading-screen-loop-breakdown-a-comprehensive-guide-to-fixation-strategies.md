### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 If rolling back the graphics driver doesn’t help, it’s likely that your device drivers are faulty or outdated. To fix the constant FIFA 21 crashes and avoid other potential gaming issues, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 You can do this manually by going to the manufacturer’s websites, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using Driver Easy. **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-2.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged device driver especially your graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2-2.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Now that all the device drivers are up-to-date, you can expect FIFA 21 to run properly. If not, try the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Verify integrity of your game files

 As you may know, missing or damaged game files can cause a game to crash. So when your FIFA 21 gets stuck in crashing, one thing you should always do is to validate the game files.

**1)** Navigate to the game’s folder via the following path:

C:\Users\<username>\Documents\FIFA 21

**2)** Right-click the**fifasetup.ini** file and click**Open with** \>**Notepad** . You can also use other similar editing tools.

**3)** On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** and**F** at the same time to open the Find box. Then, paste**DIRECTX\_SELECT** and click**Find Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_12-33-04.jpg)

**4)** After locating the right text, set DIRECTX\_SELECT as below:

* If**DIRECTX\_SELECT = 1** , change**1** to**0**
* If**DIRECTX\_SELECT = 0** , change**0** to**1**

**5)** Press**Ctrl** and**S** on your keyboard at the same time to save the changes.

 After you apply the settings above, the DirectX error message should be gone and FIFA 21 can run properly. If the game is still unplayable, read on to find more fixes below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6 – Modify the in-game settings

 You may have set high in-game settings for a better visual effect and gaming experience, but if your computer is not powerful enough to cope with that, FIFA 21 will crash. You can try the following lower settings:

**1)** Launch FIFA 21 and click**Game Settings** from the menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_17-32-34.jpg)

**2)** Set the settings as below:

* **Resolution** : Windowed Borderless
* **Rendering Quality** : Low
* **MSAAOptions** : Off

 So how FIFA 21 works with the new settings? If it still crashes, please check out the next fix.

### Fix 7 – Disable overlay

 The overlay feature you’re using may prevent FIFA 21 from working as well. To let the game runs without interruption, make sure to turn off overlay whether you’re playing on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[Origin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
