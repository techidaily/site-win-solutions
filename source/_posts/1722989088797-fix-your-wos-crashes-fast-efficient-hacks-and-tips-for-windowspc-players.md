### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is vital to the game performance. So, to prevent Jurassic World Evolution from crashing and avoid other potential issues, you should keep your graphics driver up to date.

There are two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Manually** – You can download the most recent correct graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website, such as[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[**Intel**](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) . Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 The game should run smoothly with the graphics driver updated. But if not, there are more fixes below.

### Fix 2 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files can cause Jurassic World Evolution to crash, so it’s necessary to validate the game files for troubleshooting. We’ll show you how to do this both on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

1. Launch Steam and navigate to the**Library** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3 – Remove conflicting applications

 According to other players, some audio applications like**Nahimic Sonic Studio** or**Sonic Radar** will interfere with Jurassic World Evolution and result in the crashing problem. If you have also installed these two programs on your computer, try uninstalling them and see if that helps.

 If you’re still unable to play the game, continue to the next fix then.
