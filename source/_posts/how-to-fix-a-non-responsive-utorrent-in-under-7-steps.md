### Fix 1: Restart via Task Manager

 Obviously, like what the warning said, the first thing is to close all uTorrent processes. To do it, you can end uTorrent and its related services in Task Manager and run it again.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager.
2. Select**uTorrent** and select**End Task** .
3. Click**File > Run New Task** .
4. In the window that opens, click**Browse…**
5. Navigate to the following path to launch uTorrent:  
 C:UsersAppDataRoaminguTorrent

 The error should be gone now and you can try the download again to test the issue. But if not, you can try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Run as admin

 This error can also be caused by limited access to download the file. Huge data transferring may make your account suspicious, thus your uTorrent needs admin privileges to work normally again. To avoid it, you can run uTorrent as admin permanently:

1. Right-click uTorrent and select**Properties** .
2. Check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** .
3. Click**Apply > OK** .
4. Restart your computer then run uTorrent again.

### Fix 3: Allow uTorrent through Firewall

 Although the uTorrent setup wizard can automatically add an exception for uTorrent in Windows Firewall, you may have to add uTorrent as an exception manually in other antivirus or security apps.

Follow the links below to check how to do it:

### Fix 4: Disable proxies

 Besides boosting internet performance, proxy servers can also enable people to browse privately by hiding their IP. However, proxy servers are known to conflict with some network-based apps such as uTorrent. To fix this error, you can disable proxy servers:

1. Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time and enter**inetcpl.cpl** .
2. Go to the**Connection** tab and then select**LAN settings** .
3. Uncheck the box next to**Use a proxy server for your LAN** .

 For security and stability concerns, we recommend using Nord VPN instead, and you get a discount of up to 83% by getting the **[Nord VPN coupons](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Now you can restart uTorrent to test if the issue still persists. If it keeps not responding, then check the next fix below.

### Fix 5: Deleting app data

 Corrupt app data is also reported as another main cause of the problem. The recent changes on your computer may have corrupted the local configuration files, which causes your uTorrent to fail to read these data, hence causing uTorrent not responding error.

 To fix it, you just need to navigate to the application configurations folder and delete the saved data from there.

1. Press the Windows logo key + R, enter**%AppData%utorrent** in the Run box.
2. Delete all the contents of the folder present.
3. Restart your computer and launch uTorrent again.

### Fix 6: Delete downloading files

 It may be the downloading file that is causing your uTorrent unresponsive. To fix it, you can simply go to the Download directory and delete all downloaded files.

 When you restart your uTorrent, it will resume the downloading task and this error may disappear now.

### Fix 7: Reinstall the application

 If all of these workarounds fail to solve your issue, you can perform a clean reinstall.

1. Press Windows + R, then enter**appwiz.cpl** in the Run box.
2. Right-click uTorrent and select**Uninstall** .
