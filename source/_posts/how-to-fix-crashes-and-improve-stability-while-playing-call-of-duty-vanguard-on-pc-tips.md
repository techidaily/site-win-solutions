 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the virtual memory is not sufficient to save temporary files, applications running on your PC might crash.

 In this case, follow the instructions below to increase the size of your virtual memory:
