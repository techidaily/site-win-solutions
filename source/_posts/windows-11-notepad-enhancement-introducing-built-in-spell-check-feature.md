## Windows 11 Notepad Enhancement: Introducing Built-In Spell Check Feature

Notepad's basic functionality hasn't stopped it from being used for quick notes, editing configuration files, and everything in between. The most daring of you might have even used it to store passwords at one point or another (please don't do this). Still, Microsoft has been on a mission to make Notepad not as barebones and a bit more feature-rich, especially now that WordPad is gone for good. Now, Microsoft has added spellcheck to it.

 The latest update to [Notepad](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/market-dominance-keyphrases-for-successful-advertising/), version 11.2402.18.0, is now being rolled out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels for Windows 11, bringing along a significant addition—spellcheck functionality. With the new update, Notepad will now highlight misspelled words, making it easier for you to identify and correct errors. Additionally, autocorrect functionality has been integrated to rectify common typing mistakes as users type. If Notepad thinks you misspelled something, it might try to correct it to the correct version.

 Misspelled words are automatically underlined in red, just like they're underlined on spellcheckers across literally any app or service. You can click, tap, or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + F10 on a misspelled word to view suggested spellings and immediately update the word by selecting a suggestion. You also have the option to ignore words in a single document or add them to the dictionary to prevent them from being flagged as mistakes again. Spellcheck in Notepad also supports multiple languages.

 While the spellcheck feature is enabled by default for some file types, it is turned off by default for log files and other file types commonly associated with coding—after all, it might actually mess with those kinds of files. If you don't like having a spellcheck or autocorrect at all, you can toggle this setting on or off globally or for specific file types within the Notepad app settings or temporarily for the current file through the context menu.

 If you want to check it out, this updated version of Notepad will almost certainly land on the next major update to Windows 11, and possibly before that as a smaller app update. Microsoft just [rolled out a Windows 11 update](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-precision-control-for-incredible-android-time-lapses/) back in February, with another one expected sometime this fall season.
