### Key Takeaways

 You can use Excel's ISBLANK function with a cell reference as the argument, for example "=ISBLANK(A1)", to check if that cell is blank or non-blank. Combine it with other functions to perform actions depending on the result.

 Microsoft Excel's 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function enables you to check whether a cell is blank or not. You can use this function in conjunction with the `IF` function to determine what happens to your cells when they're blank or non-blank. Here's how to do it.

##  What Is the ISBLANK Function in Excel?

 Excel's 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function lets you check if the specified cell is blank or not. If the cell is blank, the function retrieves a 

        `TRUE`
    
 value. If the cell is not blank, you get a 

        `FALSE`
    
 value. You can use these values with other Excel functions, like `IF` , to perform actions on or in response to your blank and non-blank cells.

 The syntax of the 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function is:

=ISBLANK(value)

 Here, `value` refers to the reference of the cell that you want to check. So if you want to check whether or not cell A1 is blank, you would insert `A1` in place of `value`.

 Excel also offers other functions for working with blank cells, like `COUNTBLANK` that gives you the [total count of blank cells](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revel-in-richness-your-pcs-pathway-to-exceptional-video-quality/) in the specified range. If you already know whether a cell is blank or not but want to know what type of value it contains, you can use functions like `ISNUMBER` to check if a specified cell contains any numbers, or `ISTEXT` to check if a cell has a text value.

##  Check If a Cell Is Blank With Excel's ISBLANK Function

 To use the function, first, open your spreadsheet with the Excel app and click the cell where you want to display the function's result.

![Select a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-select-cell-excel.png) 

 In the selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. In this function, replace `C2` with the cell that you want to check.

=ISBLANK(C2)

##  Perform an Action When a Cell Is Blank or Non-Blank

 Often, you may want to [perform an action depending on your cell's status](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-google-assistant-on-your-lock-screen-of-huawei-phone-by-drfone-android/). You may want to display a message that says something when your cell is blank and says something else when your cell isn't blank.

 To do that, combine the `ISLBLANK` function with Excel's `IF` function.

 First, open your spreadsheet with Excel. Then, click the cell where you want to display your function's result.

![Choose a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-choose-cell-excel.png) 

 In your selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. Here, replace `C2` with the cell that you want to check (if it's blank or not), `Sale Not Made` with the text you want to use if the cell is blank, and `Sale Made` with the text if the cell is not blank.

=IF(ISBLANK(C2),"Sale Not Made","Sale Made")

 To use the function for all your records in the spreadsheet, from the bottom-right corner of the cell where you've entered the function, drag downwards covering all your records.
