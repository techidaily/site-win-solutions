### Key Takeaways

 You can use Excel's ISBLANK function with a cell reference as the argument, for example "=ISBLANK(A1)", to check if that cell is blank or non-blank. Combine it with other functions to perform actions depending on the result.

 Microsoft Excel's 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function enables you to check whether a cell is blank or not. You can use this function in conjunction with the `IF` function to determine what happens to your cells when they're blank or non-blank. Here's how to do it.

##  What Is the ISBLANK Function in Excel?

 Excel's 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function lets you check if the specified cell is blank or not. If the cell is blank, the function retrieves a 

        `TRUE`
    
 value. If the cell is not blank, you get a 

        `FALSE`
    
 value. You can use these values with other Excel functions, like `IF` , to perform actions on or in response to your blank and non-blank cells.

 The syntax of the 

        `ISBLANK`
    
 function is:

=ISBLANK(value)

 Here, `value` refers to the reference of the cell that you want to check. So if you want to check whether or not cell A1 is blank, you would insert `A1` in place of `value`.

 Excel also offers other functions for working with blank cells, like `COUNTBLANK` that gives you the [total count of blank cells](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revel-in-richness-your-pcs-pathway-to-exceptional-video-quality/) in the specified range. If you already know whether a cell is blank or not but want to know what type of value it contains, you can use functions like `ISNUMBER` to check if a specified cell contains any numbers, or `ISTEXT` to check if a cell has a text value.

##  Perform an Action When a Cell Is Blank or Non-Blank

 Often, you may want to [perform an action depending on your cell's status](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-google-assistant-on-your-lock-screen-of-huawei-phone-by-drfone-android/). You may want to display a message that says something when your cell is blank and says something else when your cell isn't blank.

 To do that, combine the `ISLBLANK` function with Excel's `IF` function.

 First, open your spreadsheet with Excel. Then, click the cell where you want to display your function's result.

![Choose a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-choose-cell-excel.png)

 In your selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. Here, replace `C2` with the cell that you want to check (if it's blank or not), `Sale Not Made` with the text you want to use if the cell is blank, and `Sale Made` with the text if the cell is not blank.

=IF(ISBLANK(C2),"Sale Not Made","Sale Made")

 To use the function for all your records in the spreadsheet, from the bottom-right corner of the cell where you've entered the function, drag downwards covering all your records.
