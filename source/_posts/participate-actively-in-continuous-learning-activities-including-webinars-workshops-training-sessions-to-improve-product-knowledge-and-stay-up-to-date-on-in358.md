### Fix 7: Update your graphics driver

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, your game may encounter a crash. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get a good gaming experience.  
 There are two ways to update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-the-witcher-3-pc-crash/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update video card drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with Free version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)
4. Run the Witcher 3 and check the crash will appear or not.
