## 5\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If all else fails, it’s time you check whether you have missing or corrupted system files, which will negatively affect your system’s performance and even trigger some errors. In this situation, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to run the command sfc /scannow. But most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **Download** and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with full technical support. If you encounter any issues when using Fortect, feel free to contact their support team.

 Upon the completion of the repair, try to install Minecraft and you should be able to do it successfully.
