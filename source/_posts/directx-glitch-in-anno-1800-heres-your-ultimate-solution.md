### Fix 2: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Anno 1800, Unisoft, keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent bug has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required for the problem. So it’s recommended that you go to **[Ubisoft official website](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/)**  , check for the latest patch, download and install it. Then check if it fixes the Anno 1800 game crash problem.
