 If this solution doesn’t solve the issue, take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Shaders issues in COD titles could mean that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . We always recommend gamers to keep their GPU drivers up to date so as to avoid compatibility issues. If you don’t know when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

 You can update your graphics driver manually: first you need to identify your GPU model, then go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and search and download the latest correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating the GPU driver, restart your PC for the changes to apply. Then start your game and check if you can now complete the compilation.
