## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The HLL developers release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. Itâ€™s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Hell Let Loose again to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didnâ€™t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Disable Steam Overlay

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** .**right-click** on _Hell Let Loose_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck**Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 If youâ€™re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that youâ€™ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch HLL and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you may need to reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 See if HLL crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix failed to resolve this issue, try the next fix, below.
