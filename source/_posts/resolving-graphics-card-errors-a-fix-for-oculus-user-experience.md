 Many players reported the Warzone dev error 6328 can be caused by network glitches. To see if that’s the case, try troubleshooting your router and modem.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 An outdated or faulty graphics driver will also trigger Warzone dev error 6328\. If you can’t remember the last time you updated your device drivers, definitely do it now as this could make a big difference to your gaming experience.

Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 3 – Run Warzone on DirectX 11

 If Warzone dev error 6328 constantly occurs and the game keeps crashing, you could switch to the DirectX 11 mode, which, as other users reported, gives a smoother gameplay. Here is how to do this:

1. Run the Blizzard Battle.net client.
2. Select**Call of Duty: MW** on the left pane and click**Options > Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11.jpg)
3. Click the**Game Settings** tab. Then tick**Additional command line arguments** and enter**\-D3D11** in the text field.

4. Click**Done** to confirm.

 Restart Warzone for the changes to take effect. See if you could get rid of the 6328 error now. If the problem persists, there are a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory serves as additional RAM when your computer gets low on memory. Increasing the virtual memory could be a helpful boost when you’re running resource-demanding applications like COD Warzone.

1. Click the**Start** button and type**advanced system settings** in the Windows search bar. Then click**View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-1.jpg)

 Microsoft recommends you set the virtual memory no less than **1.5 times** and no more than **3 times** the amount of RAM on your computer. Here is a guide on [how to check RAM on your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 5 – Delete the game cache files

 The faulty game files can also lead to various issues with Warzone including the 6328 dev error. In this case, you should try cleaning up the cache.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**%programdata%** and press**Enter** .
2. Delete the **Battle.net**  and **Blizzard Entertainment** folder.

 Restart the Battle.net client and see whether you could play Warzone as normal. If the game is still unplayable, try the last method.

### Fix 6 – Adjust the in-game graphics settings

 If you’re able to get into Warzone and the error 6328 appears only in the middle of the game, tweaking certain graphics settings might help the situation. Here’s how:

1. Launch CoD Warzone and access the**Options** menu.
2. Navigate to the**Graphics** tab. Then set the_Display Mode_ to**Fullscreen Borderless** , and turn_Sync Every Frame (V-Sync)_ to**On (Enabled)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to the Details & Textures section and set_Texture Resolution_ and_Texture Filter Anisotropic_ to**Normal** .
