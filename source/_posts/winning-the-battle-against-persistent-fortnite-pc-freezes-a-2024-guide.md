## Winning Against Lag: Expert Fixes for Dota < 2> - Update Your Game Now

Delays and lags in-game are no doubt ruining the fun of the game. If that’s a problem for you when you’re playing Dota 2 and you want to fix Dota 2 lag during gameplay, you’re in the right place.

## Try these fixes

 There’re 2 types of lag relevant to gaming – one is FPS lag, the other is network lag. If you’re experience the FPS lag, usually you can adjust your graphics settings to fix it. If you’re experiencing network lag instead – your network connection has slowed down, you can check for bandwidth-hungry apps and your network settings.

 Here’re some know fixes for the Dota 2 lagging issue. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[End unwanted background programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 One of the most common causes of lags during gameplay is the faulty or incompatible graphics driver. If Dota 2 starts lagging after you updated the graphics driver, you’ll need to **[roll back the driver to the previous version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; if you haven’t made any changes to the driver, then **[try updating it to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
