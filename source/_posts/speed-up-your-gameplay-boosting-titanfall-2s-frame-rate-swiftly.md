### **Fix 1: Check If your PC meets the minimum system requirements for League of Legends**

 League of Legends FPS may drop if your PC fails to meet the minimum hardware requirements for the game. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements first:

* **The minimum system requirements for League of Legends:**

| **Operating System:** | **Windows XP** (Service Pack 3 ONLY),**Windows Vista** ,**Windows 7** ,**Windows 8** , or**Windows 10** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**        | **2 GHz** processor (supporting SSE2 instruction set or higher)                                         |
| **Memory:**           | 1 GB RAM (**2 GB of RAM for Windows Vista and newer** )                                                 |
| **Graphics:**         | **Shader version 2.0 capable video card**                                                               |
| **Resolution:**       | Up to**1920 x 1200**                                                                                    |
| **DirectX:**          | **DirectX v9.0c or better**                                                                             |
| **Storage:**          | **8 GB** available hard disk space                                                                      |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play League of Legends with a PC which just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the recommended system requirements for League of Legends below.

 **You may need to upgrade your hardware if your PC fails to meet the minimum system requirements of League of Legends.**

### **Fix 2: Update your graphics driver**

 This issue may occur if the graphics driver on your PC is missing or outdated, so make sure your graphics driver is up to date. By updating your graphics driver, you can not only keep your graphics card in good condition, but also avoid many unexpected issue while playing games.

There are two ways to update your graphics driver: **manually**  and **automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually**  – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact graphics card model and your version of Windows.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from**the manufacturer** . They‘re**all certified safe and secure** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install **Driver Easy** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap759.png)
3. Click **Update**  next to your graphics card to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee  ).
