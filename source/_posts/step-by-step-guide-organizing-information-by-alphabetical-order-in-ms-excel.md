## How to Alphabetize a Row in Microsoft Excel

 To alphabetize the data in a row in Excel, you will have to configure an additional option.

 To do so, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In the spreadsheet, select the entire table whose data you want to alphabetize. Do not select any table headers. In the following spreadsheet, we will not select "Name," "Age," "City," and "Country" as they are table headers.
