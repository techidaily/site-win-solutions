## How to Alphabetize a Column in Microsoft Excel

[To sort data](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-record-lectures-on-mac/) A to Z (descending) or Z to A (ascending) in a column, use Excel's quick sort option. This option moves the relevant data in other columns as well so your table remains intact.

 To get started, [open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/). In the spreadsheet, click the header of the column in which you want to alphabetize data.

![Select a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-select-column.png) 

 In Excel's ribbon at the top, click the "Data" tab.

![Click the "Data" tab in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-excel-data-tab.png) 

 In the "Data" tab, under the "Sort & Filter" section, you will find options to alphabetize your data. To sort your data A to Z, click the "AZ" icon. To sort your data Z to A, click the "ZA" icon.

![Click the "AZ" or "ZA" sort option in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-alphabetize-column-excel.png) 

 A "Sort Warning" window will open. This window suggests that you allow Excel to adjust the data in other columns so your data remains intact. Enable the "Expand the Selection" option and then click "Sort."

## How to Alphabetize a Row in Microsoft Excel

 To alphabetize the data in a row in Excel, you will have to configure an additional option.

 To do so, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In the spreadsheet, select the entire table whose data you want to alphabetize. Do not select any table headers. In the following spreadsheet, we will not select "Name," "Age," "City," and "Country" as they are table headers.

![Select the table in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6-select-table.png) 

[In Excel's ribbon](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-honor-play-40c-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/) at the top, click the "Data" tab.

![Click the "Data" tab in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/7-data-tab.png) 

 In the "Data" tab, under the "Sort & Filter" section, click "Sort."

![Click "Sort" in the "Sort & Filter" section of the "Data" tab in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-sort-excel.png) 

 In the "Sort" window that opens, at the top, click "Options."

![Click "Options" on the "Sort" window in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-sort-options.png) 

 You will see a "Sort Options" box. Here, select "Sort Left to Right" and click "OK."

![Select "Sort Left to Right" and click "OK" in the "Sort Options" box in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-sort-left-to-right.png) 

 Back on the "Sort" window, click the "Sort By" drop-down menu and select the row which you want to alphabetize. Then click the "Order" drop-down menu and select either "A to Z" or "Z to A" sorting.

 Finally, at the bottom of the "Sort" window, click "OK."

![Configure the sort options on the "Sort" window in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11-alphabetize-rows-excel.png) 

 And immediately, Excel will alphabetize the selected data in your spreadsheet.
