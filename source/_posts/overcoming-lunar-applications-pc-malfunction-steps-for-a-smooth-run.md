## Fix 2: Update your Steam client and games

 Before using the Remote Play feature, make sure your Steam client is updated. It can be a prerequisite to use the feature smoothly.

## Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 A number of bugs can be fixed by performing a dirver update.

## Fix 4: Disable hardware encoding

 Hardware encoding is that it reduces the load on your CPU by using a purpose-built piece of hardware. It’s enabled by default to give you the maximum performance. But there is a possibility that it hinders your Remote Play from functioning properly. So you and your friends should disable it from the Steam client. To do this, follow the instructions below:

 1) Open your Steam client. Click**Steam** and select**Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png" border="0">Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a>

![disable hardware encoding Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-hardware-encoding-Steam.jpg)

 2) In the left pane of the window, select**Remote Play** . Then click**ADVANCED CLIENT OPTIONS** .

## Fix 5: Disable IPv6

 IPv 6, Internet Protocol version 6, is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). But it isn’t necessarily more secure than IPv4\. While many users have IPv4 and IPv6 running and allowing traffic on both types of network addresses, some applications might not be able to adapt to IPv6\. And this would cause some connection issues and can be the cause of Steam Remote Play not working. So to fix it, you need to disable IPv6.

## Fix 6: Use a static IP address

 Most devices use _dynamic_ IP addresses, which are assigned by the network when they connect and change over time. While when a device is assigned a _static_ IP address, the address does not change. Despite the fact that most users don’t need static IP addresses, some remote access solutions only trust certain IPs for security purposes. So if you can’t use the Steam Remote Play feature, using a static IP address might be working.

To set a static IP address, you can:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**ncpa.cpl** and press**Enter** .

![open network connections window to set a static ip address
](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/use-a-static-ip-address-open-network-connections-window.jpg)

 3) Right-click on your**active network adapter** , whether it’s Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Then select**Properties** .

![set a static ip address to fix Steam Remote Play not working issue](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/right-click-on-active-network-adapter-and-select-Properties.jpg)

 4) In the**Properties** window for the adapter, select**Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and then click the**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/set-a-static-ip-address-to-fix-Steam-Remote-Play-not-working-issue.jpg)

 5) Select the**Use the following IP address** option. Then type in the**IP address** ,**Subnet mask,** and**Default Gateway** corresponding to your network setup.

![set a static ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/set-a-static-ip-address-2.jpg)

To check them, you can:

* Right-click on the Start button and select**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .

![how to check your ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-my-ip-address.jpg)

* Copy and paste the following command line and press**Enter** .  

**ipconfig /renew**  

![how to check my ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-my-ip-address-how-to.jpg)

* Now you can see your**IPv4 Address, Subnet Mask and Default Gateway** .  

![my own ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/my-own-ip-address.jpg)

 After you’ve set a static IP address, try connecting to your devices to check if it works.
