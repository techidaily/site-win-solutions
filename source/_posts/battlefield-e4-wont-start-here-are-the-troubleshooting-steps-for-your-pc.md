## 3\. Update your drivers

 After you’ve confirmed the integrity of your game files is intact and you have the latest Windows version, it’s time you check if your drivers,**especially your graphics driver** , are up-to-date. Using outdated drivers can cause a wide variety of issues with your programs. Therefore, you should check if there are any driver updates available.

 To update your drivers, you can either do it automatically by going to the Device Manager or directly head to the manufacturers’ official websites to download and install the correct drivers for your system. This is obviously time-consuming. If you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers on your own, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater tool to help you automatically detect the outdated drivers, download and install the driver updates.

3. Click **Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.

## 4\. Disable background applications

 If you’re experiencing launching problems when using Rockstar Games Launcher, it could be due to a third-party application running in the background. In this situation, you can disable applications running in the background by following the instructions below.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R**  keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **taskmgr** and press Enter.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the Processes tab, right-click on the programs that you don’t necessarily use and select **End task** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-programs-running-in-the-backgroundend-task.jpg)

 Then relaunch your game. If this doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next fix.

## 5\. Run the launcher as administrator

 If your game fails to launch properly, it could be due to the lack of administrative rights. To fix it, try to run the Rockstar Games Launcher as an administrator by following the instructions below.

1. From your desktop, right-click on the Rockstar Games Launcher icon and select**Properties** .  

![run Rockstar Games Launcher with compatibility mode with administrator priviledges](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/select-Properties.png)
2. In the Properties window, select the**Compatibility** tab. Then check the box next to**Run the program as an administrator** .  

![rockstar games launcher run as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/run-as-administrator.png)

 Then click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.

 If your problem persists, don’t worry. Below are some other fixes you can try.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Delete the Rockstar Games folders

 If none of the fixes listed above help, you should try deleting the Social Club folder from**Program Files** and**Program Files (x86)** . It’s usually located on**C:\\Program Files\\Rockstar Games** and**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/delete-social-club-folder-rockstar-games-launcher-2.png)

 Then try to run your game from the Rockstar Games Launcher. If the error message still pops up, it’s time to delete the Rockstar Games folder from OneDrive.

 Navigate to**C:\\Users\\\*YourUserName\*\\Documents\\** . Then find the Rockstar Games folder and delete it.

 After you’ve done these, launch your game and you should be able to enjoy your gameplay without getting any error messages.
