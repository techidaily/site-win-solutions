## 2\. Disable unnecessary programs

 Too many programs running in the background will most likely drain your system as they take up a certain amount of resources. To get a better gaming experience, you’re supposed to disable those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo + R keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste**taskmgr** and press Enter to open the Task Manager.

3. Under the Processes tab, right-click the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint and select**End task** .  
 (Be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly. )

 After you’ve done these, play your game. If you’re still having sudden extreme framerate drops and stuttering during the gameplay, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Enable the Game Mode

 Now launch Naraka: Bladepoint and you should get a better performance. However, if turning on Game Mode didn’t do the trick, don’t worry. Below are some other methods that you can try.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re having performance issues, verifying game files may work like magic. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files are intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or replace any corrupted files. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-properties.jpg)

 The verification process would take several minutes to finish. After that, play Naraka: Bladepoint to check if your problems have been solved. If you are still having these problems, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable overlays

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .
