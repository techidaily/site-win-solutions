### Bonus Tip: Update available device drivers

 The missing or outdated device drivers can bring your computer various problems, such as Discord not working or sound problems. So you should keep your device drivers up to date.

 In addition, if you want to have the best possible experience when playing games, you should update your device drivers, especially drivers for your graphics card and sound card.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your hardware devices, find the latest correct driver for your device, then download and install it manually into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** and get a**30-day money back guarantee** ).
