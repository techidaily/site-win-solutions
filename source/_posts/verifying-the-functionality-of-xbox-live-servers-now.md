## Fix 2: Uninstall incompatible app

 Make sure there’s no other software working on the background. It’s possible that some apps are incompatible with Steam which cause the sound issue. Some players figured out when they had Sonic Studio on, there’s an audio mixer or no sound. After installing the software, the Dying Light was working perfectly.

## Fix 3: Update your driver

 Sound issue often relates to your sound card and the audio driver. If your audio driver is outdated or wrongly installed, you may encounter sound issues.

 You can updating drivers by going to the manufacturer’s official website, then download and install the latest driver which compatible with your operating system.
