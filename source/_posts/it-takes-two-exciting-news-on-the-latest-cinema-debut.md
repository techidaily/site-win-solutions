### Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 The broken or outdated graphics driver often play a key role in not launching or crashing issues. Graphic driver will effect your graphic card and influence your gaming experience. The fix is simple, updating your graphic driver to the latest version which compatible with your operating system.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually by visiting the website of your GPU manufacturer. Search for your GPU model, download the latest driver and install it.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 3: Disable overclocking or turbo boosting

 If you’re using third-party software to overcook the CPU or GPU to gain better performance, you’d better disable it when running the game. It may be the culprit of the not launching issue.

 So disable the software and reset the CPU or the GPU to the manufacture specification that meets the minimum requirement.

 Some certain overclocking or turbo boosting features need to be disabled from the BIOS. You need to disable the Intel Turbo Booster in BIOS settings if needed.

If this fix doesn’t work, please move to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your DirectX files

 It Takes Two asks for DirectX 11 to run properly. If the DirectX files is corrupted or missing, the game would not launch or crash on startup. Therefore, updating the DirectX files to the latest version would fix the issue.

2. Click the**Download** button.  
![download latest DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-latest-DirectX.jpg)
