## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Using outdated drivers can affect performance. So we recommend checking for driver updates on a regular basis. If you do encounter the Steam black screen issue, updating your drivers especially the video card driver is a good step in troubleshooting.

There are two ways you can update your video card drivers:

[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-steam-black-screen-or-not-working/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Manually update your drivers

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep releasing driver updates. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer and open Steam client to check if the issue is fixed. If not, try the other fixes below.

## Fix 2: Delete web browser cache

 The Steam desktop client has a built-in browser that can show you details of a game. So users use it quite frequently. But the problem is, Steam doesn’t automatically clear its web browser cache. This would in turn cause Steam not to load properly. To fix it, you should clear the cache.

Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Open your Steam client. From the menu bar, click Steam and select**Settings** .

![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/settings.jpg)

 2) From the left panel, click**Web Browser** . Then click**DELETE WEB BROWSER CACHE** . Once it’s done, click**DELETE ALL BROWSER COOKIES** . After it’s finished, simply click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-web-browser-cache-Steam.jpg)

 Now your Steam client should be running as normal. If the black screen issue persists, you should[delete the app cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 3: Delete app cache

 The app cache in your Steam directory stores various data about your Steam apps and setup essentially it remembers small details each time you open Steam ensuring that the next time you run Steam, things will work that little bit faster. However, things can go wrong with the cache. It can miss remembering things which may be a cause for Steam not loading properly. To fix this, try deleting the app cache folder. And you don’t need to worry because this will be recreated the next time you open Steam.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **E**  at the same time to open File Explorer.

 2) Navigate to**Windows (C:) > Program Files (×86) > Steam** to go to the Steam directory.

 3) Copy and paste the**appcache folder** to a safe location just in case something goes wrong.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/appcache-folder.jpg)

 4) Now you can**delete the appcache folder** in your Steam directory. Then try starting Steam again. If it works well, you can then go and delete the original backup appcache folder as a healthy new one will be created in its place.

## Fix 4: Participate in the Steam Client beta

 Opting into the Steam Client Beta lets you use the latest features before they’re released. An update might help you fix the black screen issue.

To participate in the Steam Client beta, follow the instructions below:

 1) With Steam running, click**Steam** in the upper left, then select**Settings** .

![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/settings.jpg)

 1) Exit Steam. From your desktop, right-click on the Steam shortcut and select**Properties** .
