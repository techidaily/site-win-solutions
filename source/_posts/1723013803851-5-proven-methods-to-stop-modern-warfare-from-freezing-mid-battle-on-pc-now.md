### Method 1: Install the latest patch

 So check for updates for Civilization VI and install any available updates. Then restart your computer and see if the game stops crashing or not.

### Method 2: Stop overclocking your CPU

 Overclocking means setting your CPU and memory to run at speeds higher than their official speed rate, and almost all processors ship with a speed rating. However, this may cause your game crashing or freezing. In that case, you should set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to fix your issue.

### Method 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If device drivers in your computer are missing or outdated, especially your graphics card driver, you may have the game crashing issue. To rule it out as the culprit for CIV 6 crashing, try updating your video card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/civ-6-crashing-on-pc-solved/#O2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Your device manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website of your graphics card, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake while installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

Now launch CIV 6 and see if the crashing issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Use Medium or Low settings for your game

 Settings a high graphics effect for your game may crash your computer, so it’s always a go-to option to set the graphics options to Medium or Low.

 For example, you should go to Civilization VI >**Game Options** \>**Graphics** , then set settings like**Medium** or**Low** , including**Performance Impact** ,**Memory Impact** ,**Visual Effects** ,**Water Quality** , etc.

 You can choose Windowed mode as your Display Type and see if it stops crashing your computer.

### Method 5: Disable DLC for CIV 6

 Usually the game developers release Downloadable Content (DLC) for players, which is additional content created for an already-released video game to have better experience.

 If you use DLC when playing Civilization VI, try disabling DLC for your game, as DLC may bring unknown bugs to your game sometimes.

 If CIV 6 works properly after turning off DLC, then you should stop using DLC when playing your game, or report your issue to the game support.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 6: Turn off antivirus program for your game

 Running antivirus programs in your computer can cause your game crashing, as your antivirus program may detect your game program as virus or something, and antivirus program will try to stop your game from running.

 So if you’re running antivirus programs in your computer, try disable the antivirus program, then see if CIV 6 can launch and play properly.

 If CIV 6 runs smoothly and no crashing occurs, the antivirus program is the culprit.

 Disabling antivirus program all the time is not recommended since it protects your computer from attacks. So ensure to add CIV 6 to the exception in your antivirus program, then you can run CIV 6 and antivirus program at the same time.

Still no luck? Okay, there is one more thing to try.

### Method 7: Reinstall CIV 6

 If your problem still persists after troubleshooting the methods above, try reinstalling your game.

Here’s what you need to do:

 1) Launch**Steam** in your computer, and log into your Steam account.

 2) Click**Library** \>**Games** .
