## Windows 11 Taskbar Malfunction Solutions - Get Yours Back in Action

Windows 11 has been launched for months and many users have upgraded to Windows 11\. But some users have reported they can’t find the taskbar or it’s not working suddenly. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. My taskbar is not working after lunchtime and it’s troublesome. The post is here to help.

## Try these fixes

 There’re 5 fixes that have helped users solve their problems. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Restart your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Restart Windows Explorer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Microsoft fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Repair system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Restarting your PC might be the easiest working fix to try. And it works most of the time. Follow the steps to restart your PC when the taskbar is not working or disappears.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Alt + Del** key together.
2. In your right bottom of the screen, click the**power button** and choose Restart.

If this simple reboot doesn’t work, the next fix might help.

### Fix 2: Restart Windows Explorer

 The taskbar is part of the Windows Explorer service, so rebooting the service and starting the new task may solve the problem.

1. Press the**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** key on your keyboard together to open the Task Manager.
2. In the**Processes** tab, find Windows Explorer.
3. Right-click on it and choose**Restart** .

### Fix 3: Microsoft fix

 The Microsoft support team discovered an issue with a server-side deployment that went out to Insiders and canceled that deployment. You can follow the steps below to get back into a working state on your PC.

1. Press the**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** key on your keyboard together to open the Task Manager.
2. Click**File** and choose**Run new task** .
3. Type cmd and press the Enter key.
4. Copy and paste the following into the command panel. Then hit the Enter key on your keyboard.  
 reg delete HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\IrisService /f && shutdown -r -t 0
5. Your PC will reboot and everything should be back to normal.

### Fix 4: Repair system files

 Windows taskbar issues could be related to the Windows system files. When Windows system files are missing or outdated, it may trigger bugs like the taskbar not working or disappearing from the desktop.

 Therefore, you need a tool to check the system files and repair the corrupted files automatically. If you’re familiar with command codes, you can run**System File Checker** to check the system files. But it takes time and you have to enter the correct command.

 Or, you can turn to a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your PC and fix them automatically. We recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , as it’s tailored to the Windows system and works in a private way.

### Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 When your graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, it may hinder user interface suche as taskbar to work properly. There are two ways to check if your graphics driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.

**Checking manuall** – If you’re a savvy user and don’t mind spend sometime on it, you can go to the manufacturer’s official webpage ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), downlaod the correct driver and install it manually.

**Checking automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
