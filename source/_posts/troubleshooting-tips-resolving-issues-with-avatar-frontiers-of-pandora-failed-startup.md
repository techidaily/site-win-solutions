## 1\. Check system requirements

 If your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can’t launch, the first thing you should do is to make sure that your computer is above the minimum system requirements. Here’s the detailed information for your reference:

| Minimum   | Recommended                                                                                         |                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS        | Windows 10/11 (64-bit versions)                                                                     | Windows 10/11 (64-bit versions)                                             |
| Processor | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 @ 3.6 GHz, Intel Core i7-8700K @ 3.70 GHz, or better                               | AMD Ryzen 5 5600X @ 3.7 GHz, Intel Core i5-11600K @ 3.9 GHz, or better      |
| Memory    | 16 GB (running dual-channel mode)                                                                   | 16 GB (running dual-channel mode)                                           |

| Storage   | 90 GB available storage (SSD)                                                                       | 90 GB available storage (SSD)                                               |

* **GeForce** RTX 20/30/40 series: RTX 2060/3050/4060 or better;
* **Intel** Arc A series: ARC750 or better.

 As you can also see from the table, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora could have rather high requirements for your computer like Valhalla, when compared to other games. So if your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora doesn’t launch, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for it to run.

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information:[**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

 When you’re sure that your machine meets the system requirements to run the game, but Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora still refuses to launch, please move on to the other fixes below.

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

 Then try to open Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again to see if it launches successfully. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

---

## 3\. Disable conflicting software

 Sometimes, Ubisoft can be a bit sensitive about certain programs running in the background. Here’s a list of software that could most likely interrupt the proper launching of Ubisoft and its services:

* MSI Afterburner
* Anti-virus or anti-spyware software
* VPN, proxy, or other firewall and security software
* P2P or file-sharing software
* IP filtering or blocking software
* Download manager programs

 So before you start Ubisoft, make sure to close all unneeded applications:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
2. Select each resource-hogging application and click **End Task** to close them one by one.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-49.png)

 Then run Ubisoft again and see if Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launches well now. If not, please move on.

---

## 4\. Update device drivers

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora not launching problem, so if the above methods don’t help Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora to launch, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 5\. Verify game files on Ubisoft

 Corrupted or missing files will stop your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora from running or launching as well. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on Ubisoft in this way:

1. Open Ubisoft Connect, and find Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora under the**Games** tab.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png" border="0">Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes. Create screensavers for yourself, for marketing or unlimited royalty-free commercial distribution. Make screensavers from images, video and swf flash, add background music and smooth sprite and transition effects. Screensaver Factory is very easy to use, and it enables you to make self-installing screensaver files and CDs for easy setup and distribution. Screensaver Factory is the most advanced software of its kind.</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Select**Properties** , then**Verify files** under Local files.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-30.png)
3. If prompted, select**Repair** . Ubisoft Connect will then download and restore any missing or corrupted files.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-32.png)

 When the verification is done, try to launch Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again to see if it launches well now. If not, please move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Add Avatar to your antivirus exception list

 The reason why your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora refuses to launch may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Ubisoft.

 Since Ubisoft consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when running, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and the former may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Ubisoft as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you aren’t sure how to do it.

## 7\. Repair damaged or corrupt system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could help fix performance issues like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora refusing to launch. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause crashes, freezes, and problems that affect gaming performance, or even its launch.

 Repairing the core Windows system files may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to games’ not launching problems. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 Fortect comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee. If you’re not satisfied with Fortect, you can contact <support@fortect.com> for a full refund.

 (Tips: Still unsure if Fortect is what you need? Check this [Fortec Review](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ! )

 Please note that system file repair alone might not help to fix the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora not launching problem. It’s one troubleshooting step to try, and its refusal to launch can also be caused by factors we mentioned above, like outdated graphics drivers, outdated Windows, game file problems, etc. Still, a clean Windows system free of file errors is a good foundation for stable gaming.
