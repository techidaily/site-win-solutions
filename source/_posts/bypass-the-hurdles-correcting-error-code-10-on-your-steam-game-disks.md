To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

1. Open Steam Client.
2. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1.png)

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

### Fix 5:**Run Steam as administrator**

 The fatal error may be related to issues with game installations or with Steam updates. So you can grant Steam administrator privileges so that it can run in the most optimized way. Once you’ve done that, check if the error still occurs.

Here is how to run Steam as administrator:

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s.png)
2. Click the**Compatibility** tab, then tick the**Run this program as an administrator** box. Finally, click**Apply** \>**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-4.png)
3. Re-launch Steam and the game.
4. Check if the Steam Fatal Error is fixed.

 Error still persists? Don’t worry. Here are a few more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Check for an update

 The error may be an unresolved bug of a previous version. Whenever the developers are aware of the issue, they would try to fix it and release a new version. You can check Steam or the game in question to see if there’s a new update available. Once you make sure you’ve installed the latest update of Steam and the game, check to see if the fatal error is fixed.

 Still no luck? Please try**Fix 8** , below.

### Fix 8: Reinstall Steam

 If you’ve exhausted all possible fixes but the error still happens, you can reinstall Steam as a last resort. Many players may fear this would delete all installed games, but you can easily save them by backing up the Steamapps folder – that way you wouldn’t need to redownload a single game after reinstalling Steam.

**To back up the Steamapps folder:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Windows-logo-key.jpg) and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.
