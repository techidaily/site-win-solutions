## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

 The verification process would take several minutes to finish. After that, play Naraka: Bladepoint to check if your problems have been solved. If you are still having these problems, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable overlays

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .
