**5)** Relaunch Wolcen to see if it launches now.

If your game is still unplayable, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Clear game cache folders

 Game cache files accumulated on your computer will affect your gaming performance and cause errors. To see if the Wolcen launching problem is caused by this, follow the instructions below to see how to delete game cache folders:

**5)** Restart Lords of Mayhem to check if it starts correctly now.

If the game still won’t load, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the Wolcen launching issue.

 To do this, you can visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer, (such as **[ AMD](<https://www.amd.com/en/support>**
**Nvidia)**  ,[**Nvidia**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  , etc.) and download the driver manually.

 But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
