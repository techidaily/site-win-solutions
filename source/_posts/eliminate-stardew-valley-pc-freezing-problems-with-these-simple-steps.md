### Fix 2: Run the game as an administrator

 Certain game files on your PC may require administrative access before using. If you’re running the game under normal user mode, it might not be able to access some files and crashes.

 To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below:

**1)** If you’re running Steam now, right-click the**Steam icon** on the taskbar and select**Exit** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-14_9-46-42.jpg)

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**2)** Right-click the**Steam icon** and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-14_10-11-20.jpg)

**3)** Click**Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-14_9-46-46.jpg)

**4)** Restart Mordhau.

If your issue persists, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Mordhau works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this didn’t work for you, try the fix below.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of game files

 If Mordhau still won’t launch properly or crashes every now and then, try verifying the integrity of game files to see if any files are damaged or missing. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam client.

**2)** Click**LIBRARY.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-14_9-46-51.jpg)

**3)** Right-click**Mordhau** and select**Properties** .

**5)** Relaunch Mordhau to test your issue.

### Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 Having the latest correct graphics driver can help you get the best performance out of your hardware and fix common game issues such as game crash, lag, or abnormal display.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your graphics card:**manually or automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website** for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Change PC power settings

 Windows sets all computers to the Balanced power plan by default. This means that your computer may slow down to save energy, which can cause Mordhau to crash. To see if that’s the problem for you, try changing your power plan to**High Performance** . Here is how:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

**5)** Restart your computer and Mordhau to test your issue.

If your game is still unplayable, move on to the fix below.

### Fix 7: Configure your virtual memory

**Virtual memory** is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 Try optimizing your virtual memory to see if it fixes Mordhau crashing issues. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**advanced system settings.**
