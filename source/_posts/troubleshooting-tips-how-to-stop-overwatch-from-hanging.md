### Fix 5: Update your video driver

 If the fixes above didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a video driver problem,

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your video driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your video driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your video card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your video driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa3888b6a8a.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa38934c6ad.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and check if YouTube now works properly. If it doesn’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Fix 6, below.

### Fix 6: Update Adobe Flash Player

 Most video stream portals use Adobe Flash Player to stream videos. If Adobe Flash Player is old, or somehow corrupt, missing, it may cause YouTube to freeze. You can update Adobe Flash Player and see if it solves your problem.

Here’s how to update Adobe Flash Player

1. Visit the[**Adobe Flash Player website**](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/) .
2. Click**Install Now** to download the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa384304614.jpg)
3. Double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the program.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Check if the YouTube problem is resolved.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Use a different browser

 Sometimes you may need a different browser. Perhaps the web browser you are using is incompatible with the YouTube web player. Maybe its configuration, extensions or plugins (like Adobe Flash Player mentioned above) are preventing videos from playing on YouTube.

 You can download a different browser from its official website, and install it on your computer. Then play a YouTube video on that browser and see if this fixes your “YouTube keeps freezing” problem. If this helps, you may need to consult your browser support and ask them for advice.
