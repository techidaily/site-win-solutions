## 2\. Verify game files

 Corrupted or damaged game files could also be the culprits to the crashing of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon, and verifying game files from within Steam helped to fix the crashing problem, according to some gamers in the Steam forum. So the next thing you should do here is to repair the game files. To do so:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on your game and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Installed Files** tab and click on the**Verified integrity of game files** button.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)  

 Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 When the game files are verified and repaired, launch Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon from Steam again to see if the crashing problem still remains. If so, please move on.

## 3\. Run the game as admin and in compatibility mode

 Some gamers reported that running Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon as administrator (and preferably in compatibility mode as well) also helped to stop it from crashing. This is probably because giving the game administrator privileges ensures its full rights to do anything it needs on your computer. Lacking certain rights to use system files could be the reason why Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon crashes at some point.

 To check if that’s your case, you can try running it as an administrator:

1. Right-click your **Steam** icon and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-56.png)
2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-57.png)
3. Then tick the box for **Run this program in compatibility mode for:**  then select **Windows 8** from the dropdown list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-58.png)

 Now open Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon again (it should be opened with administrative permission), to see if it still crashes. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon’s crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help to fix it, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

## 5\. Turn off RTX (Ray Tracing)

 If your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon usually crashes in the middle of the game, it’s probably helpful if you can**turn off Ray Tracing** , which helps to produce realistic lighting effects, adding an extra level of realism to the game. But ray tracing also takes much processing power, which could cause problems like game crashing or freezing. To see if turning of ray tracing helps:

1. Launch Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon and go to settings. Then click SYSTEM.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-59.png)
2. Select**Graphics Settings** , then**Quality Settings (Detailed)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-60.png)
3. Select Ray Tracing Quality at the bottom, and set it to  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-61.png)
4. Select**OFF** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-62.png)
5. Then play the game and see if the crashing stops.

If Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon still crashes, please move on.

## 6\. Make sure your graphics card and CPU are not running hot

 An overheated computer environment is also one of the most common reasons why your game crashes. If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
