### Fix 2 – Try an alternative browser

 Roblox is compatible with all leading browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and more. To make sure Roblox works well on your device, make sure you’re using the latest version of the browser.

 If you’re still unable to get into a Roblox game from your current browser, try a different one to see if it works. For example, if you can’t launch your Roblox game from Chrome, try opening Firefox and launch the game.

 If Roblox won’t load the game from any browser, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 3 – Reset your Internet Options

 In some cases, you can fix Roblox loading issues by resetting your PC’s Internet Options.

 You’ll need to open Internet Explorer to perform the following steps, but this will fix problems even if you use other browsers, such as Chrome, to play the game.

**1)**  Run **Internet Explorer** .

**2)** Click the **gear button** on the top-right corner of your screen, then click **Internet options** .

### Fix 4 – Disable your ad-blocker/extensions

 Browser extensions, especially ad-blockers that modify page content could also interfere with Roblox. So if you’re running any browser extensions, you may also want to try disabling them.

 This process varies slightly in different browsers. If you’re using Chrome, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Open Chrome.

**2)** Click the **Menu** button.

### Fix 5 – Check your Firewall

 As with all multiplayer games, Roblox requires an internet connection to send and receive data.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time.

### Fix 6 – Temporarily close your anti-virus

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and firewall and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
