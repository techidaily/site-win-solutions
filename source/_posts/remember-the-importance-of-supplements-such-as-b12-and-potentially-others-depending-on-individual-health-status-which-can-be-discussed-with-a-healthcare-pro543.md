### Method 3: Check your antivirus software

 Sometimes your antivirus software may be the reason for the Fallout 76 stuttering issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.
