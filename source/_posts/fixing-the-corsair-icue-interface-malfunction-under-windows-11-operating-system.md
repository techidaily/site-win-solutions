## Fix 1: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of It Takes Two release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. Itâ€™s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run It Takes Two again to see whether the FPS is back to normal. If it didnâ€™t work, or there are no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If you havenâ€™t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, because the outdated or faulty graphics driver may be causing It Takes Two FPS dropping issue.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually â€“** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, youâ€™ll need to visit the manufacturerâ€™s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically â€“**  If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)

## Fix 3: Turn off Steam Overlay

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _It Takes Two_ . Then select **Properties** .
2. In the GENERAL section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

 By defualt, It Takes Two will automatically select the graphics settings that suits your hardware. If you want to get some extra FPS and performance, you can play with the graphics settings in the game.

 Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower some in-game graphics settings.

 If the FPS still doesnâ€™t improved after you optimized the graphics settings, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar

 Microsoft introduces many gaming features to Windows 10, such as background recording, Xbox Game Bar, etc.. Once enabled, theyâ€™ll constantly run in the background, hogging a ton of resources.

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Click**Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Close other demanding apps running in the background

 The It Takes Two FPS dropping issue may occur if too many applications or programs are running at the same time in the background. So **try restricting applications and downloads in the background** before playing the game to see if the game would run smoothly. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open **Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of **CPU** , **memory** and **network**  and then click **End task**  to close it.

## Fix 7: Set the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance

 A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings that manages how your computer use power. In most cases, the power plan on PCs are configured to **Balanced** , which may limits the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Windows 10 allows you to customize the power plan on your PC. If the power plan of your PC is **Power saver**  or **Balanced** and youâ€™re experiencing the FPS dropping issue, try setting the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .
