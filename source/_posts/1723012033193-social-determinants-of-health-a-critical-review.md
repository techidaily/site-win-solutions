### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If that’s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases. There’s no need for you to download the patch manually, as it would be detected and automatically installed by Steam. You can wait around and see if the issue is fixed.
