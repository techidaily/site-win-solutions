 Fix 3: Adjust your graphics settings

 According to some players, tweaking the in-game settings of Resident Evil Village has helped them resolve the lag issue in Resident Evil Village. You could try it too and see how it goes:

* Screen resolution: Native
* Image Sharpening: Off
* Vertical sync: Off
* Power Management : Prefer Maximum Performance
* Low Latency Mode : Off
* Rendering mode: Normal
* FidelityFX CAS: Off

### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If that’s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases.
