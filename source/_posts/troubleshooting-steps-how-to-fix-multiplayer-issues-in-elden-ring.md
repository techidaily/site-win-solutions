 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your issue persists, move on to the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited access to the files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how:

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .
