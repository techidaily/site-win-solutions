 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

### Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited access to the files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how:

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-02.jpg)

**2)**  Go to the **Compatibility tab** , then check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-12.jpg)

**3)**  Click **Apply** , then **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-23.jpg)

**4)** Restart your game to see if this worked.

 If the game crashing issue continues to occur, then go ahead with Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Turn off unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time during gameplay, your PC might get overloaded and crash your game. Or, in some cases, one of your programs is conflicting with your game and causes it to fail.

 So, it’s recommended that you close unneeded programs while gaming. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_11-02-46-1024x251.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select End Task.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

**3)** Relaunch your game to see if this fixed your issue.

If it didn’t, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 4: Verify your game files

**1)** Run**Epic Games Launcher** .

**2)**  Click **Library** , then click **the Settings icon** .
