### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, Warzone won’t work properly with your GPU when you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . So first you need to make sure you have the latest correct graphics driver. The newest driver usually helps improve compatibility and boost in-game performance.

 You can update the GPU driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), searching your graphics card and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can update the GPU driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
