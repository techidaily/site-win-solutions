### Fix 5: Update your graphics card driver

 When you meet the game freezing issues, it might relate to your graphics card. Rocket league freezing issue may be caused by missing or outdated drivers. So it’s really important to keep your drivers up-to-date to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.
