### Fix 2 – Close background applications

 When multiple applications are running in the background simultaneously, your Black Desert Online may crash due to limited resources or software conflicts. It’s a good idea to shut down other unneeded programs before you start playing.

**1)** Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

**2)** Right-click the application you want to close and click**End task** .

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Launch Black Desert Online and see if the crashing issue goes away. If not, continue with the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver matters a lot to your gaming performance. A corrupted or outdated graphics driver can trigger various issues like game freezing and crashing. If you don’t remember the last time you checked for driver updates, definitely do it now as it might fix the Black Desert Online crash right away.

 There are two ways you can update the graphics driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to tackle the compatibility issues with new game patches and improve the display performance. To get the correct graphics driver, you need to visit their websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then, find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit). Then, download it and install it step by step.

#### Option 2 – Update the graphics driver automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/de-1-4.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/de-2-4.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Does Black Desert Online run smoother now? Or does the game still crash for no reason? If the latter, check out the next fix then.

### Fix 4 – Clear the game cache

 The corrupted game cache is also a common cause of Black Desert Online crashing. You can clear the game cache to see whether that stops the crash. Here’s how:

**1)** Close your game client.

**2)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open the File Explorer.

**3)** Click**Documents** , and double-click the**Black Desert** folder.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1-6.jpg)

**4)** Click the**UserCache** folder and press the**Delete** key on your keyboard.

 Restart your game to test the issue. If it still persists, keep reading the next fix.

### **Fix 5 – Delete the xcorona file**

 Deleting the xcorona file works like a charm for many players stuck in the same Black Desert Online crashing situation. Give it a shot to see if this fix applies to your scenario as well.

**1)** Navigate to **Black Desert Online installation folder > bin64 > xc > na > 1** , and delete the**xcorona.xem** file.

**2)** Go to the **Black Desert Online installation folder > bin64 > xc > na > 2** , and delete the**xcorona.xem** file.

 Now check if your game runs perfectly without any crashes. If this method still doesn’t work, try the last one.

---

### Fix 6 – Perform a fresh reinstall of Black Desert Online

 If all else above couldn’t stop the endless crashing, it’s better for you to reinstall Black Desert Online, as this will solve stubborn underlying issues.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-0-1.jpg)
