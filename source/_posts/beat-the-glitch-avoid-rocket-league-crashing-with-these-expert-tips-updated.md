### Fix 1: Restart your computer

 Sometimes a game may crash or stop responding because of a temporary issue that you can fix by restarting your device. So before you move on and try any other fixes, restart your PC first.

 If Rocket League still crash after the reboot, read on and try Fix 2, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: **Run your game as an administrator**

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user. This means your game has limited permission to access game files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the core issue of Rocket League crashing issues, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png" border="0"></a>

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-342.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-342.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-352.png)

**3)** Click **Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-353.png)

**4)**  Relaunch Rocket League from Steam.

If your game still crashes, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card or GPU is the most important hardware when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver, you’re likely to run into game issues.

 If that’s the issue for you, updating your graphics driver should fix it. You can update your graphics driver manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**4)** Relaunch the game to test your issue.

If Rocket League crashes again, move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 4: Delete game cache files

 The Rocket League crashing issue may occur when one or more game cache files are corrupted. If this happens to you, clearing the game cache files can fix the issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-274.png)

**3)** Right-click on **Cache** and select **Delete** .

**6)** Type **\-autoconfig** , then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-279.png)

### Fix 7: Change PC power settings

 The power plan on all computers is set to Balanced by default. Under Balanced mode, your computer sometimes might slow down automatically to save energy, which could lead Rocket League to crash.

 To fix it, you need to change your power plan to **High performance** . Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-737.png)

**2)** Under **View by,** click **Large icons** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-720.png)

**3)** Select **Power Options.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-721.png)

**4)** Select **High Performance** .

**What are the differences?**
**Balanced:**  Balanced automatically adjust your CPU’s speed according to your computer’s need.  
**High Performance:** High Performance mode keeps your PC running at high speeds most of the time. Your computer will generate more heat under this mode.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-738.png)

**5)** Restart your computer and your game.

If your issue persists, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 8: Reinstall your game

 If none of the fixes above worked for you, it’s very likely that the game is not properly installed on your PC and reinstalling it is the solution for you. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)
