## Fix 1: Temporarily disable background programs

 If your computer runs several resource-hogging applications in the background, your game will be more likely to be stuttery. Hence, to resolve the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla stuttering issue, you need to suspend those unnecessary programs. Here are the steps you can follow:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **taskmgr** and press **Enter** .

![open task manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/open-task-manager.jpg)

 3) Under the **Processes**  tab, select the programs that are CPU-intensive. Right-click on them and select **End task** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you don’t want some programs running automatically, you can select the **Startup**  tab, right-click on them and select **Disable** .

![prevent programs from running automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/prevent-programs-from-starting-automatically.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once you’ve disabled programs running in the background, launch your game to check if it’s still stuttering.

## Fix 2: Disable Windows 10 gaming features

 Game Mode is a feature in Windows 10 that focuses system resources on games when enabled. It was supposed to make gaming a much better experience, but it seems the opposite is true. And if you have background recording enabled on your system, it may cause micro stutters and even freezes. So to get rid of stutters, you need to disable the background recording feature and turn off Game Mode. To do so, take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** to open Settings.

 2) Click**Gaming** .  
  
![turn off game mode to fix Assasin's Cree Valhalla stuttering on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/turn-off-game-mode-to-fix-Assasins-Cree-Valhalla-stuttering-on-PC.jpg)

 3) Select**Game bar** and set the**Record game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game bar** option to**Off** .  
  
![turn off recording](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/turn-off-recording.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) From the left sidebar, select**Captures** . In the**Background recording** section, set the**Record in the background while I’m playing a game** option to**Off** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) From the left sidebar, select**Game Mode** and set**Use Game Mode** option to**Off** .  
  
![turn off game mode windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/turn-off-game-mode.jpg)

 After applying the changes, play your game to check if the issue persists. If that didn’t work, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update the graphics card driver

 Your device drivers, the graphics card driver, in particular, are very important because it directly impacts your game performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics card driver, you’re more likely to encounter stuttering. In order to fix it, you need to update your graphics card driver.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: manually and automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Manually update your graphics card driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) release updates for their drivers regularly. All you need to do is go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer. Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers. For Nvidia users, you can also use GeForce Experience to check for the driver.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics card driver (recommended)

 Updating drivers manually can be time-consuming and risky. So if you don’t feel like doing it on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically detects, downloads, and installs the correct or missing drivers for your system. And you can also roll back to your previous driver version if you’re not satisfied with the updated one.

Here’s how it works:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NVIDIA-RTX-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After you’ve updated your drivers, restart your computer for them to take effect. Then launch your game to check if the problem persists.

 If updating drives didn’t resolve your issue and you want to roll back your drivers to the previous version, take these steps:

 1) From the left panel, click**Tools** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/roll-back-to-a-previous-version.jpg)

 2) Click**Driver Restore** .

## Fix 4: Set priority to high in Task Manager

 Windows shares processor resources between all running processes based on their priority level. If a process has a higher priority level, it gets more processor resources for better performance compared to a process having lower priority. So in order to get rid of stutters, you should set your priority to high for your game. Here are the steps you can take:

1) Launch your game.

2) When the game is running, right-click on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
  
![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-Task-Manager.jpg)

 3) In the**Processes** tab, navigate to**ACValhalla\_Plus** . Right-click it and select**Go to details** .  
  
![set the priority to high ACValhalla](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/set-the-priority-to-high-ACValhalla.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Now you’re navigated to**ACValhalla\_Plus.exe** . Right-click it and select**Set priority > High** .  
  
![set the priority to high ACValhalla to fix the game stuttering on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/set-the-priority-to-high-ACValhalla-to-fix-the-game-stuttering-on-PC.jpg)

 5) Click**Change priority** .  
  
![change priority ACValhalla](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/change-priority.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now play your game and your issue should be resolved.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 6: Turn off overlays

 If you have in-game overlay enabled, it may cause noticeable stuttering. To fix it, you need to turn them off.

 1) Open UBISOFT CONNECT. On the top left corner, click on the three parallel lines.

## Fix 7: Optimize in-game settings
