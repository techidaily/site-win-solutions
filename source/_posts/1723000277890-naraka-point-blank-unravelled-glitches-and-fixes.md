If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphic driver is one of the most common reasons for Naraka: Bladepoint keeps crashing on PC. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Device Manager fails to detect an available update, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. If your game still crashes after you updated the graphics driver, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Verify your game files

 If any of the game files of Naraka: Bladepoint on your PC are missing or corrupted, the game can crash at any point during the gameplay. You can use the game launcher to verify the integrity of your game files. Here’s how:

**On Steam** :

1. Open your Steam library and find Naraka: Bladepoint. Right-click the game then click**Properties** .

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Paste**sysdm.cpl** in the box, then click OK.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-sysdm.cpl-.jpg)
3. Go to the**Advanced** tab, under the Performance section, click**Settings** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789" border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Again switch to the**Advanced** tab, under the Virtual memory section, click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/virtual-memory-change.jpg)
5. Now you’ll see the paging file size on your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-07.jpg)

**To manually allocate paging file size** :

 If you want to increase your virtual memory to fix the crashing issue, or for a better gaming experience, follow the steps below:

1. UNCHECK the box of**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** , then select**Custom size** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-55.jpg)
2. Use the below formulas to calculate the values you should set:  

_**1GB = 1024 MB**_  
 _**Initial size (MB) = 1.5 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_  
_**Maximum size (MB) = 3 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_
3. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, press the**Windows key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Then type in**msinfo32** and click**OK** . You’ll find the information in the pop-up window.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-msinfo32.jpg)
4. Calculate and fill in the**Initial size and Maximum size** , click**Set** then click**OK** . For example, I have 8 GB RAM, so my initial size would be 8\*1024\*1.5=12,288 MB, and my maximum size would be 8\*1024\*3=24576 MB  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/custom-size.jpg)
5. Restart your PC to let the changes take effect.

If your game still crashes, try the next fix.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

## Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run.

 By doing a clean boot, you can identify if any background program was interfering with Naraka: Bladepoint and causing the crashing issue.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)

 If Naraka: Bladepoint doesn’t crash anymore, this means at least one of the programs you disabled was causing the problem.  
  
**Here’s how to find out which one(s):**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .

2. Under the**Services** tab, tick the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox**,** then tick the checkboxes in front of**the first five items** in the list.  
 Then click**Apply** and**OK** .

3. Reboot your computer and launch the game. If it once again won’t crash, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ crash, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Naraka: Bladepoint.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

2. Switch to the**Startup** tab, and**enable the first five startup items** .

3. Reboot and try launching Naraka: Bladepoint to see if it still crashes.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with the game.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.
