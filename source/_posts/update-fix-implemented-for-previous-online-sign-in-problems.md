### Fix 1: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlays allow you to unlock achievements, place orders and chat with friends during gameplay. Sounds convenient, right? But there’re also reports that in-game overlays could actually crash your game. So if you’re using any in-game overlays like**Steam** ,**Discord** and**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** , you can try disabling them and see if it stops the crashes.

For example, here’s how you can disable the Steam overlay:

1. Open your Steam client. On the top left corner, click**Steam** and select**Settings** .

 If this method doesn’t help your case, simply continue to the next one.

 Some gamers mentioned that they manage to solve the crash as well as the black screen error by running the game as administrator. You can try the same as it might fix your crash in a snap.

1. Go to your Steam library. Right-click**Hades** and select**Properties** .
2. Navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab, select**BROWSE LOCAL FILES…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steam-browse-local-files.jpg)
3. Right-click**Hades.exe** and select**Run as administrator** , then check if the game stops crashing. If it does, continue to the next step to always run Hades as administrator. Otherwise, please move on to the next solution.
4. Right-click**Hades.exe** and select**Properties** .
5. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab. Under the**Settings** section, check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**OK** .

### Fix 3: Verify your game files

 Game crashes may indicate an integrity issue with your game files. If that’s the case, chances are your game will keep crashing at a certain mode or scene. To scan and repair missing files, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to your Steam library and right-click**Hades** , then select**Properties…** .
2. In the Properties window, navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
3. Wait for the checking to complete.

 Once you’ve done verifying integrity of game files, launch Hades and see if it crashes again.

 If this solution doesn’t do the trick for you, please take a look at the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of crashing is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If the last time you updated or installed your graphics driver feels like ages ago, definitely do an update now as it might be the cure to your crashing issue.

 GPU manufacturers update their drivers frequently so as to quickly adapt to the fast-changing game market. The updates usually include bug fixes, performance boost and compatibility improvements, which can to some extend prevent the game from crashing.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, first visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then search the model of your graphics card. Be sure to select the latest correct driver installer according to your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-all-rtx-3090.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated the graphics driver and restarted your computer, open Hades and see if the crash persists.

 If this method doesn’t give you any luck, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 As you may have known, overclocking is basically a zero-cost benefit, as it provides dramatic performance boost using the same hardware. But you should note that it could also trigger instability of your system. So if you’re running overclocking programs, such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Intel Extreme Tuning Utility** **(Intel XTU)** , you can try to turn them off and check if it fixes the crash.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 On some occasions, your game might have crashed due to some**software conflicts** . You can try to root out the offender by**performing a clean boot** , which starts Windows with only the basic drivers and startup programs.

You can follow these steps to do a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the run box. Type or past**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-1.png)
2. Navigate to the**Services** tab. Check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. Find services that **DO NOT** belong to your graphics card or sound card manufacturers such as**NVIDIA** ,**AMD** ,**Realtek** and**Intel** . **Uncheck**  the boxes next to these services and click **OK** .

           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"

	<div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and test your gameplay in Hades.

 If the crash stops, you can root out the offender by repeating these steps and disable only half of the services.

If the crash reappears, please continue to the next solution.

### Fix 7: Temporarily disable your anti-virus programs

 The crash with Hades could be triggered by your anti-virus software. This is actually pretty common with new games, as the virus library might not update as frequently as you’ve expected. You can therefore try to disable your anti-virus programs, such as**Windows Defender** ,**Window Security** ,**Norton** and**Avast** , as they might be interfering with your game.

 So these are the fixes to your Hades crashing issue. Hopefully, you’ve solved the problem and can start making your way up the Olympus. As always, if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop a line and we’ll get back to you.
