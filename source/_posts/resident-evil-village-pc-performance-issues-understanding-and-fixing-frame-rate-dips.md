## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Using outdated drivers can affect performance. So we recommend checking for driver updates on a regular basis. If you do encounter the Steam black screen issue, updating your drivers especially the video card driver is a good step in troubleshooting.

There are two ways you can update your video card drivers:

[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-steam-black-screen-or-not-working/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Manually update your drivers

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep releasing driver updates. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

## Fix 2: Delete web browser cache

 The Steam desktop client has a built-in browser that can show you details of a game. So users use it quite frequently. But the problem is, Steam doesn’t automatically clear its web browser cache. This would in turn cause Steam not to load properly. To fix it, you should clear the cache.

Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Open your Steam client. From the menu bar, click Steam and select**Settings** .

![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/settings.jpg)

 2) From the left panel, click**Web Browser** . Then click**DELETE WEB BROWSER CACHE** . Once it’s done, click**DELETE ALL BROWSER COOKIES** . After it’s finished, simply click**OK** .  
  
![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-web-browser-cache-Steam.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Now your Steam client should be running as normal. If the black screen issue persists, you should[delete the app cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Delete app cache

 The app cache in your Steam directory stores various data about your Steam apps and setup essentially it remembers small details each time you open Steam ensuring that the next time you run Steam, things will work that little bit faster. However, things can go wrong with the cache. It can miss remembering things which may be a cause for Steam not loading properly. To fix this, try deleting the app cache folder. And you don’t need to worry because this will be recreated the next time you open Steam.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **E**  at the same time to open File Explorer.

 2) Navigate to**Windows (C:) > Program Files (×86) > Steam** to go to the Steam directory.

 3) Copy and paste the**appcache folder** to a safe location just in case something goes wrong.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/appcache-folder.jpg)

 4) Now you can**delete the appcache folder** in your Steam directory. Then try starting Steam again. If it works well, you can then go and delete the original backup appcache folder as a healthy new one will be created in its place.

## Fix 4: Participate in the Steam Client beta

 Opting into the Steam Client Beta lets you use the latest features before they’re released. An update might help you fix the black screen issue.

To participate in the Steam Client beta, follow the instructions below:

 1) With Steam running, click**Steam** in the upper left, then select**Settings** .

![delete web browser cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/settings.jpg)

 2) Select the**Account** tab. Under the**Beta Participation** section, click the**CHANGE…** button.  
  
![participate in Steam Client beta](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/participate-in-Steam-Client-beta-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Select the “Steam Beta Update” from the drop-down list and click “OK”.  
 You will be prompted to restart Steam, please select the “Restart Steam” button.

 After you’ve done this, try restarting Steam to see if the issue persists. If it didn’t do the trick for you, try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Add –no-cef-sandbox in your Steam shortcut

 The command line argument**\-no-cef-sandbox** is exactly what you need if Steam is not loading properly. It would probably help you fix the issue by adding the argument in the shortcut. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Exit Steam. From your desktop, right-click on the Steam shortcut and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Click the**Shortcut** tab. In the**Target** section, type**\-no-cef-sandbox** at the end. Then click**Apply > OK** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-cef-sandbox.jpg)

Now try opening Steam client to check if it works.

## Fix 6: Reinstall Steam

 If nothing works, there’s a quick way to reinstall it while keeping all your preferences and games intact. To do this, you can follow the steps below:

 1) Exit Steam.  
 To make sure you completely exit Steam, open Task Manager and look for**Steam Client Service** and**Steam Client WebHelper** . Right-click on them and select**End task** .  
  
![End task Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/end-task.jpg)

 2) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **E**  at the same time to open File Explorer.

 3) Navigate to**Windows (C:) > Program Files (×86) > Steam** to go to the Steam directory.

 4) Delete everything except**steamapps** ,**userdata,** and**steam.exe** **(steam Application)** .

## If your problem persists…

 If reinstalling Steam doesn’t do the trick, you should give**repairing your PC** a shot. Program issues such as Steam not loading can be caused by corrupted system files.
