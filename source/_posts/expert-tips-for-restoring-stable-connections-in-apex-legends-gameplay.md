### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The game crashing issue is probably caused by your outdated graphics driver. Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can make your game run smoother and prevents many issues or errors.

 There are two ways to update your graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact graphics card model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 4: Run Windows Compatibility Troubleshooter

**Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** is a built-in tool in Windows OS that can check whether programs are compatible for your current Windows OS or not. The game crash issues often occur when some program settings are not compatible with the current Windows OS.

 Just follow the steps below to run**Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** :

 1) Go to the directory where Rage 2 is installed.**Right-click** on the file**RAGE 2.exe** and select**Properties** .

 Usually the default directory is**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Bethesda.net Launcher\\RAGE 2** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-124.png)

 2) Navigate to**the Compatibility tab** and click**Run compatibility troubleshooter** .

 3) Click **Try recommended settings** to test-run program using recommended compatibility settings. Follow the on-screen instructions to see whether this troubleshooting option works or not.

 4) If it still doesn’t work, then run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter again and**select the second option** **to choose compatibility settings based on problems you notice** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pasted-image-2-1-1.png)

 5) If the problem persists, adjust the following settings manually and select**OK** when you’re done.

### Fix 5: Add Rage 2 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Rage 2.

 Since Rage 2 consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and Rage 2 may not run as expected. You can try **adding Rage 2 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
