### Fix 3:**Run Epic Games Launcher and Borderlands 3 as administrator**

 In some cases, Borderlands 3 won’t launch properly because it is not granted the necessary access to running the game. To make sure the LS-0013 error is not thrown up because of insufficient rights, you should run**Epic Games Launcher** and**Borderlands 3** as administrator.

Here is how to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator:

 1) On your desktop, right-click on the **Epic Games Launcher icon** and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Run Borderlands 3 to see if it works without fail. If yes, then you have solved the issue! If the error still happens, you can then run**Borderlands 3 as administrator** , the steps are similar as those for Epic Games Launcher.

 Once finished, don’t forget to check if the**Borderlands 3 LS-0013** error is resolved.
