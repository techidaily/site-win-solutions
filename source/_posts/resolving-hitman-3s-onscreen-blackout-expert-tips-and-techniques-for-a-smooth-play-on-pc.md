### Fix 3:**Run Epic Games Launcher and Borderlands 3 as administrator**

 In some cases, Borderlands 3 won’t launch properly because it is not granted the necessary access to running the game. To make sure the LS-0013 error is not thrown up because of insufficient rights, you should run**Epic Games Launcher** and**Borderlands 3** as administrator.

Here is how to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator:

 1) On your desktop, right-click on the **Epic Games Launcher icon** and select **Properties** .
