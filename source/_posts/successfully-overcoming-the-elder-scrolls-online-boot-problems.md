### Bonus tip: Update your graphics driver

 To keep your Fortnite running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver at all times. There are two ways you can get the right driver for your graphics product: manually or automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-fortnite-entry-point-not-found-2019-tips/#e2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Epson keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to your graphics product manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
