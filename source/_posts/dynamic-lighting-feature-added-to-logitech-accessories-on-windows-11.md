## Dynamic Lighting Feature Added to Logitech Accessories on Windows 11

Logitech G products with LIGHTSYNC RGB can now be controlled from the Windows 11 Dynamic Lighting hub. This makes it easier to sync Logitech G lighting with other products, and it opens the door to new features like app-specific lighting or notification-based lighting.

 As you build a collection of RGB-enabled devices, you'll find that the world of RGB is an absolute mess. Most brands require a unique app, meaning that a minor adjustment can quickly turn into a huge project. Microsoft aims to eliminate this problem with the [Dynamic Lighting hub](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-resolve-stop-error-0x0000001d-no-spin-lock/), which allows you to control all of your RGB accessories in a single window.

 The Dynamic Lighting system debuted in 2023\. It's tucked behind the Windows 11 "Personalization" menu and allows you to control your RGB peripherals' colors, brightness, and effects. A list of connected devices and their discreet apps are also listed in Dynamic Lighting.

 Users can also enable "Foreground" or "Background" app control. Essentially, some apps are able to run colors or effects across your Dynamic Lighting-compatible devices. Logitech believes that this feature will be used for immersive and educational purposes. A PC game may extend onscreen colors to your RGB devices, while creative apps may illuminate key combinations to help you learn keyboard shortcuts. Notifications from email or messaging clients may also control Dynamic Lighting.

 As you might expect, "Foreground" app control depends on whatever app you're actively using. Apps that are registered as ambient lighting controllers are considered "Background" appsâ€”they'll provide enhanced customization or unique effects for users and are prioritized over other Dynamic Lighting processes.

 However, the Dynamic Lighting hub isn't a magic trick. Manufacturers need to build Dynamic Lighting support for their products. It's a lot of work, and it requires cooperation. At the time of writing, Logitech and Razer are the only major players to make the leap. But several brands, including ASUS, SteelSeries, Twinkly, and Acer, have pledged support for this new standard.

 Widespread adoption of Dynamic Lighting won't occur until late 2024 or early 2025\. Once Dynamic Lighting is supported on a wide variety of products, it may become the best way to control and customize RGB. We'll just need to wait and see how things shake out.
