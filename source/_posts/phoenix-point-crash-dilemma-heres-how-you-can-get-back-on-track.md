### Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

### Fix 3: Turn off unnecessary programs

 So, it’s recommended that you close unneeded programs while gaming. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .
