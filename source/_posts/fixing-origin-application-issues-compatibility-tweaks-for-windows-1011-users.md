### Fix 1: Repair game installation

 First you need to make sure you have the latest version, and check if your game files are intact. You can do a quick check to find out.

Here’s how to do it on Nexon Launcher:

1. Open Nexon Launcher and click the**gear icon** to open settings.

### Fix 2: Check compatibility settings

 To run ancient programs on Windows 10, you might need to change some compatibility settings. Some players reported that running with admin rights and using Windows 7 settings could work. You can try the same and see how it goes.

To do so, simply follow these instructions:

1. Go to the installation path of MapleStory. Then open the**appdata** folder.
2. Find all the .exe files inside this folder. One by one, right click the**.exe** file and select**Properties** .

3. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab, Under**Compatibility mode** , check the box and select Windows 7\. Under**Settings** , check the box before**Run this program as an administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/maplestory-compatibility-2.jpg)
4. After you finish with all the .exe files, restart the game and check if it crashes again.

 If this method doesn’t help, you can take a look at the next one. (You might want to undo these steps so that they won’t affect the following fixes.)

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The constant crashes could indicate that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . Besides performance boost, the latest driver comes with bug fixes that tackle most of the compatibility issues. If you don’t know whether your video driver is up to date, definitely give it a check.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with[**Drive Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![Driver Easy Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, do a reboot and check if MapleStory stops crashing.

 If the latest drivers don’t do the trick for you, you can move on to the next solution.

### Fix 4: Edit the registry

 Another possible fix lies in the registry. You might be able to stop the crash by changing display settings in the registry:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) and type or paste**regedit** . Click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/windows-10-run-regedit.jpg)
2. In the address bar, paste **ComputerHKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINESOFTWAREWOW6432NodeWizetMapleStory** and press**Enter** . Double click**soScreenMode**  and change the value to**3** . Click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/maplestory-registry.jpg)
3. Now enter the game and test the gameplay.

 If this trick doesn’t give you luck, you can undo it and continue to the next one.

### Fix 5: Make sure Windows is up to date

 You also need to check if you’re on the latest system. Windows updates sometimes improve the compatibility of legacy software.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.

3. Click**Windows Update** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your PC and start MapleStory.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, simply try the next one below.

### Fix 6:**Use a VPN**

 It may sound strange, but there’re players mentioning that the game crash could be triggered by disconnection. If that’s your case, you can use a VPN to workaround this issue. VPN servers tend to have a more stable connection.

 But be advised that we don’t recommend free VPNs since they’re after your personal information. Even the cheapest plan gives you a decent privacy protection.

And here’re some VPNs we like:

* **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[CyberGhost VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[SurfShark VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 7: Run on a virtual machine

 There’s no easy way to say this. But instead of wasting any more time troubleshooting, you might as well set up a Windows 7 virtual machine. You can use the built-in Hyper-V, or[VMware Workstation Pro](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vmware.com%2Fproducts%2Fworkstation-pro%2Fworkstation-pro-evaluation.html&id=drivereasy-en-152886) . Both of them deliver great performance on Windows.
