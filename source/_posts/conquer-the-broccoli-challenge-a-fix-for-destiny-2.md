## Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many players would overclock their CPU or GPU to crank out extra performance out of the existing system. The downside is that, high clock speed may induce stability issues and even crashes to your system.

 If your game starts to crash after you’ve overclocked your CPU or GPU, try reverting it to the default setting. After that, fire up Destiny 2 to see if the crashing issues have ceased.
