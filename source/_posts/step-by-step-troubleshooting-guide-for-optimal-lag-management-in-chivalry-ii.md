5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if the lag problem has been mitigated. If yes, then congrats! If it’s no joy, please try **Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 The device driver, which works as a translator between your hardware component and the computer, is essential for the functioning of your computer system.

If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If that’s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases. There’s no need for you to download the patch manually, as it would be detected and automatically installed by Steam. You can wait around and see if the issue is fixed.
