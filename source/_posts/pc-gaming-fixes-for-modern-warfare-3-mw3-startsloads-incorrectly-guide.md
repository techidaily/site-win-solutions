### Bonus Tip: Update available device drivers

 The missing or outdated device drivers can bring your computer various problems, such as Discord not working or sound problems. So you should keep your device drivers up to date.

 In addition, if you want to have the best possible experience when playing games, you should update your device drivers, especially drivers for your graphics card and sound card.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your hardware devices, find the latest correct driver for your device, then download and install it manually into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.
