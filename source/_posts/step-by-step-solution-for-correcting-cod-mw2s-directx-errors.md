## 3\. Add Acrobat or Acrobat Reader to the antivirus exception list

 The AcroCEF.exe or RdrCEF.exe application error may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Acrobat or Acrobat Reader.

 Since Acrobat usually consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re using it, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and thus with the AcroCEF.exe application error. You can try   **adding Acrobat and Acrobat Reader as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you aren’t sure how to do it.
