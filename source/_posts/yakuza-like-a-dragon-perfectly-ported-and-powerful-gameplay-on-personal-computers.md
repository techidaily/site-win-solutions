## Fix 1: Allow your game through controlled folder access

 Sometimes Windows Security may block your game from running. So you should manually add your game to the list of allowed apps to prevent it from being blocked.

To do so, you can:

 1) In the **Search**  box, type **windows security**  and click **Windows Security**  from the results.

## Fix 2: Disable unnecessary programs running in the background

 Sometimes, the programs running in the background might be interfering with your game. And too many programs running in the background can overload your computer. So to avoid crashes, you’re supposed to end those tasks.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type **taskmgr** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![open task manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/open-task-manager.jpg)

 3) Under the **Processes** tab, right-click on the unnecessary or CPU-intensive programs and select **End task** . (Note: don’t close your game and Steam.)

![disable unnecessary programs running in the background to fix Yakuza Like a Dragon crashing issue.](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/disable-unnecessary-programs-running-in-the-background.jpg)

After you’ve done these, launch your game to check if it works.

## Fix 3: Update the graphics card driver

 Your device drivers, the graphics card driver, in particular, are very important because it directly impacts your game performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics card driver, you’re more likely to encounter crashes. In order to fix it, you need to update your graphics card driver.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics card driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) release updates for their drivers regularly. All you need to do is go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer. Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers. For Nvidia users, you can also use GeForce Experience to check for the driver.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics card driver (recommended)

 Updating drivers manually can be time-consuming and risky. So if you don’t feel like doing it on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically detects, downloads, and installs the correct or missing drivers for your system. And you can also roll back to your previous driver version if you’re not satisfied with the updated one.

Here’s how it works:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy to fix Yakuza: Like a Dragon crashing on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy to fix Yakuza: Like a Dragon crashing on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NVIDIA-RTX-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After you’ve updated your drivers, restart your computer for them to take effect. Then launch your game to check if the problem persists.

## Fix 6: Disable overclocking and overlays

 If you’re using MSI Afterburner or other GPU tweaking programs, you cannot play your game smoothly. The game engine doesn’t really support cards that are overclocked. And overclocking can be causing game instability and thus the game might crash. So to fix it, you should disable it.

 Also, it’s very important to remove all those overlays, Steam, Discord, or whatever overlay you’re using. It’s usually causing some issues like crashing and thus affecting your performance.

 You can disable overlays on [Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , [Geforce Experience](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and [Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) by following the instructions below:

## Fix 8: Run your game on a dedicated graphics card

 The integrated graphics chipset is built into the processor and makes sure that your computer can use a display even without a dedicated GPU. However, more demanding tasks such as gaming require a stronger GPU, which in most cases is the dedicated one.

 The biggest benefit of a dedicated GPU is performance. Not only does a dedicated graphics card have sophisticated RAM for the task of processing video, but also has dedicated RAM for the task, which is typically faster and better optimized for the task than your general system RAM.

### Find out if your computer has more than one GPU

 If you’re not sure how many GPUs your computer has, follow the instructions below to find out:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

![open Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/open-device-manager.png)

 3) Double-click**Display adapters** to expand the list. And you can see if your computer has more than one GPU.
