### Fix 1: Make sure your specs meets the requirements

 Genshin Impact is, by no means, a graphically demanding game, but having a great gaming setup always gives you a leg up. Just before you start any advanced troubleshooting,**make sure your PC specs meet the minimum requirements** . If they don’t, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

#### Minimum configuration

| **Operating system:** | Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**        | Intel Core i5 or equivalent                                   |
| **Memory:**           | 8 GB RAM                                                      |
| **Graphics card:**    | NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 1030 and higher                           |
| **DirectX version:**  | 11                                                            |
| **Storage:**          | Please reserve 30 GB of space                                 |

 If Genshin Impact crashes on your high-end gaming PC, simply continue to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Run Genshin Impact as administrator

 Genshin Impact crashing to desktop may indicate a permission issue.**Running Genshin Impact as an administrator** is a possible solution to the crash.

Here’s how:

1. Go to your installation path of Genshin Impact, then navigate to**Genshin Impact\\Genshin Impact Game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-admin-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**GenshinImpact.exe** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-admin-02.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab. Under the**Settings** section, check the boxes next to**Disable fullscreen optimizations** (if you’re on Windows 10) and**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**OK** to save the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-admin-3.jpg)
4. Run Genshin Impact and see if the crash has gone.

 If this fix failed to solve the crash, simply**undo these changes** and move on to the next solution.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the crash is**corrupted or outdated graphics drivers** . GPU manufacturers keep releasing driver updates in response to compatibility issues with new games. So if you can’t remember the last time you checked for driver updates, definitely do it now because it could just fix your issue in a jiffy.

 Of course you can update manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the graphics driver step by step. But if you don’t like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do these automatically. It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 According to some users, conflicted programs could be triggering the constant crashes. You should be extra careful if you have system tuning software on your PC (e.g.**Razer Synapse** or**MSI Afterburner** ). To check if that’s your case, you can do a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .

6. Restart your PC.

 Once done, restart Genshin and see if it crashes again. If not, repeat these steps but disable half of the services to root out the offenders.

If this trick doesn’t work for you, check out the next one below.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates include system stability improvements, and could very well solve the software conflicts in your system. If the last time you check for system updates feels like ages ago, definitely do it now as it might save you a lot of troubles.

Here’s how you can install system updates on Windows 10 or 7:

#### Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** (the i key) at the same time to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-setting-app-security-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . It might take up to an hour for Windows to download and install available updates.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click**Check for updates** again.

#### Windows 7

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Select**Control Panel** .

4. Click**Install updates** . It’ll take a while (up to 1 hour) for Windows to install all the updates.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-7-install-updates-5.jpg)

 After installing all the system updates, restart your PC and test the gameplay with Genshin Impact.

 If this method doesn’t solve your case, simply check out the next one.

### Fix 6: Change in-game resolution

 Some travelers reported that they managed to stop the crash by**changing the game’s resolution to 720p** . This is a reasonable measure that will ease the pressure on your GPU. So you can try the same to see if it helps.

And here’s how:

1. Launch Genshin Impact. Press**Esc** during gamplay and click the**gear icon** from the left.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-change-resolute.jpg)
2. From the left menu, Select**Graphics** . Change the settings of**Display Mode** to**1280×720 Windowed** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-change-resolute-2.jpg)
3. Continue your game and see if it stops crashing.

 If this method doesn’t do the trick for you, simply try the next one below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Lower in-game graphics settings

 It’s a general principle that new games tend to be buggy, and the developers are still working to improve the graphics compatibility. According to some travelers,**lowering in-game graphics settings** could stop the crash right away. So if you don’t mind playing at low graphics settings, you can go right ahead and tweak them.

And just for your reference, here’s my graphics settings:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/genshin-my-settings-1200x648.jpg)

 If the crash persists when you’re playing on the lowest graphics, you can check out the next solution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8: Run Genshin Impact on another GPU

 If your computer has more than one graphics card (e.g. PC/laptops with a built-in CPU graphics plus an additional AMD or NVIDIA graphics card), you can try to**run Genshin Impact on another GPU** .

 This is sometimes helpful if you’re using a**legacy** GPU (an old graphics card that’s no longer supported). Some CPU graphics might have a better compatibility with new games, but at the cost of performance.

 Before doing so, make sure all your graphics drivers are up-to-date. (You can go back to **[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  above for detailed instructions.)

 So here’s an example of changing the preferred GPU from an NVIDIA graphics card to the Intel HD graphics on Windows 10:

 If you’re using Windows 7 or 8, you can change the preferred GPU in**NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Radeon™ Settings** .

1. At the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select**Display settings** .

<a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-1.jpg)
2. Under the**Multiple displays** section, click**Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-2.jpg)
3. Click**Browse** to specify the file location of the Genshin Impact launcher.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-3.jpg)
4. Click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-4.jpg)
5. Select**Power saving** and click**Save** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-5.jpg)

Now you can launch Genshin Impact and see if it stops crashing.

### Fix 9: Check for corrupted system files

 If none of the fixes work for you, try scanning Windows and see if it’s a system issue.
