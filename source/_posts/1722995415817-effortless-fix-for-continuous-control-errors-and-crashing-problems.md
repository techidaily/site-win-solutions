### Fix 1: Update your graphics drivers

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience. If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may run into the Control crash issue.

 **To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver.** There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

* **Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.
* **Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DE-scan-screen.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You’ll need the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to do this and you’ll be prompted to upgrade.  

 Don’t worry; it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don’t like it you can get a full refund, no questions asked.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DE-Update-all-drivers.png)  

 (Alternatively, if you’re comfortable manually installing drivers, you can click ‘Update’ next to each flagged device in the free version to automatically download the correct driver. Once it’s downloaded, you can manually install it.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 2: Stop overclocking

 Many players would like to overclock the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking usually crashes the game. To prevent game crashes, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 Some players reported that Control may crash when they’re using MSI Afterburner or Zotac Firestorm. So if you’ve enabled MSI Afterburner or Zotac Firestorm, try disabling them to see if this issue persists. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 3: Use a reduced settings profile for graphics-related features

 If your PC fails to meet the recommended system requirements for Control, you should use a reduced settings profile for graphics-related features, because higher settings will increase the workload for your PC, which may even lead to the game crash issue. You can follow the screenshots below to lower the in-game graphics settings:

Here are the system requirements for Control:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Control-system-requirements.png)

 _The system requirements information is captured from Epic Games Launcher_

 If you’re currently running Control with DirectX 12, it’s recommended that you run Control**with DirectX 11** to avoid the game crash issues.

 Launch Control again in reduced settings to see if it crashes or not. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 5: Delete the “render.ini” file

 If the screen goes black and you’re seeing the error message ” game\_rmdwin7\_f.exe is not responding ” when you try to play Control, you can follow the steps below to fix this issue:

1. Exit the game if it’s running.
2. Go to the game’s installation folder and locate the file**render.ini** .
3. Delete the file**render.ini** .
4. Launch Control again.

 See if the game will crash or not. Normally this issue should be resolved. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Perform a Windows Update

 According to the game developers, if MS Visual C++ is missing or corrupted, you may also run into the Control crash issue. To resolve this problem, you need to reinstall Official Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and .NET Framework.

 If your PC is running on Windows 10, you can perform a Windows Update to update and install the latest version of Visual C++ and .NET Framework. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/update1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will start searching for available updates. If there are updates available, Windows will automatically download and install the updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If there are no updates related to MS Visual C++ or .NET Framework from Windows Update, you can download their installation files via the links below on your own and manually install them on your PC.

**Microsoft Visual C++ 2013** :  
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
**Microsoft .NET Framework** :  
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

 After installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and Microsoft .NET Framework, you need to restart Windows. Then launch Control to see if this issue persists. If not, congratulations, you’ve resolved this issue! If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Install the latest Control patch

 Remedy Entertainment (the developer of Control) releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that an older patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, just download and install it to see if it can fix the crashing issue; if there’s no patches available, or if the issue persists after you installed the latest patch, try the next fix below.

### Fix 8: Verify the game file

 The faulty game files may also crash the game. To fix this issue, you need to verify the game files. Here is how to do it:

1. In Epic Game Launcher, navigate to your **Library** . Click **the cog icon** on the lower-right corner of **Control** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-49-47.png)
2. Click **Verify** to start verifying the game files.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-50-45.png)

 Launch Control again after you verified the integrity of the game files. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 9: Add Control as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Control.

 Since Control consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and Control may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Control as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 10: Run Program Compatibility Troubleshooter

 If Control often crashes on your Windows 10 PC, you can try running Windows Program Compatibility Troubleshooter to run the game in Windows 7 mode. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your desktop,**right-click** on the shortcut of Control, then select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-12_12-24-18.png)
2. In the Properties Window, navigate to**the Compatibility tab** , check the box next to**Run this program in compatibility mode for:** and select**Windows 7** from the drop-down list. Check the box next to**Run as an administrator** and then click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-12_14-25-41.png)
3. Double-click the shortcut of Control on your desktop to launch it. This time Control will run in the compatibility mode you set in step 2.

See if this fix works for you. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 11: Reinstall the game

 If none of the fixes above works for you, you may need to try reinstalling the game to see if it would crash again. Normally, Control won’t crash after you reinstall it.
