## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Using outdated drivers can affect performance. So we recommend checking for driver updates on a regular basis. When you encounter the issue of a loading screen stuck, updating your drivers especially your graphics driver could be the best shot you take.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-phasmophobia-stuck-at-90-loading-screen/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Manually update your drivers

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , and[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) keep releasing driver updates. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will**automatically** recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version.

## Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs like the screen stuck at loading. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Launch Steam client. From the**LIBRARY** section, right-click on**Phasmophobia** and select**Properties** from the menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![verify integrity of game files Phasmophobia stuck at 90% loading screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-on-Properties-1.png)

 2) Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click the**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** button.

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-1200x610.jpg)

 3) Steam will verify the game’s files and this process may take several minutes. After it’s finished, launch your game to check if it works for you. If not, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Delete the game’s save file

 If your game files are corrupt, they can cause your game to be stuck on the loading screen. Deleting the files can sometimes resolve the problem:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Start-icon.jpg) and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![delete save file Phasmophobia stuck at 90% loading screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-save-file.png)

 3) Locate the**saveData.txt** file and delete it.

 4) Now relaunch your game to check if the issue is fixed.

 Deleting the saved file has proven to be working for many users. But it probably would delete your progress.

## Fix 5: Run Steam as an administrator

 Granting Steam administrative rights would probably let you play your game smoothly. So here, you can run Steam in Administrator mode.

 1) Right-click on the Steam shortcut from your desktop and select **Open file location** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-Steam-as-an-administrator-right-click-from-the-desktop-and-select-open-file-location.jpg)

 2) Scroll down and find the **Steam application** . It should be highlighted. Right-click on it and select **Properties** .

![run Steam as an administrator to fix Phasmophobia stuck at 90% loading screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-Steam-as-an-administrator-select-Properties-1.jpg)

 3) Select the**Compatibility**  tab and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK** .

## Fix 6: Reset your network

 The game stuck at 90% loading screen is an issue related to network connections. When you are troubleshooting it, one of the recommended tips is to reset the network settings. Network reset is a feature that restores all the network-related features and settings to their original values — factory state. So to fix the issue, you need to do a network reset.

Here’s how you can do this:

 1) In the Search bar, type **network reset** and click **Network reset**  from the results.  
  
![reset network](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-reset-type-in-the-search-bar.jpg)

 2) Click **Reset now** .  
  
![do a network reset](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-reset-click-Reset-now.jpg)

 3) Click **Yes** .

![reset network to fix phosmophobia stuck at 90% loading screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-reset-click-Yes.jpg)

Now restart your computer and your problem should be fixed.

## Fix 7: Uninstall and reinstall Phasmophobia

 If, unfortunately, none of the fixes listed above work for you, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling Phasmophobia. Though this will remove your progress.

Take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**%appdata%LocalLowKinetic Games** and press**Enter** .

![uninstall and reinstall Phasmophobia stuck at 90% loading screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-save-file.png)

 3) Delete everything in the**Kinetic Games folder** .

 4) Now open the Steam client. From the**LIBRARY** section, right-click on**Phasmophobia** and select**Manage > Uninstall** . When a window pops up asking for confirmation, simply click**Uninstall** .

 5) After you’ve uninstalled your game, restart your computer and reinstall it from Steam.
