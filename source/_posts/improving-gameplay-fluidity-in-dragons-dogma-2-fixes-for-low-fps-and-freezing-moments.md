## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**4)**  Relaunch_GTA5_ to test your issue.

If your issue continues to occur, then move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time while gaming, that could cause your PC to overload and make your game freeze.

 To see if that’s the cause of the_GTA5_ freezing problem, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-03-45-1024x251.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select**End Task** . Specifically, if you have the Riva Statistics software or MSI Afterburner, try turning them off when you’re gaming to see if the issue persists.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

**3)** Restart_GTA5_ to see if this fixed your issue.

If it didn’t, read on and try Fix 3.

## Fix 3: Verify your game files

 This issue might happen when one or more_GTA5_ files on your PC are corrupt or missing. If you’re playing the game on Steam, follow the instructions below to verify your game files:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** . Then, right-click**Grand Theft Auto V** and select**Properties** .

**4)** Relaunch_GTA5_ to test your issue.

 If your game still won’t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory** is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running _GTAV_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you don’t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If that’s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .

**2)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-35.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-31.jpg)

**4)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-27.jpg)

**5)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-22.jpg)

**6)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

**7)** Click **Set** , then **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-13.jpg)

**8)** Restart your computer and your game.

 If your issue still exists, don’t fret. Read on and try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Reinstall your game

 You may run into the_GTA5_ freezing issue when the game program is not properly installed on your PC. To fix it, you’ll need to reinstall the game. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Right-click **Grand Theft Auto V** then click **Manage > Uninstall.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_14-18-11.jpg)

**5)** Reinstall the game on your PC, then restart the game.

If the issue continues to occur, go to the next solution.

## Fix 6: Check for Windows updates

 In some cases, this issue is triggered by out-of-date and incompatible Windows components. Try installing all the new Windows updates to see if this fixes your issue. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-14-26.jpg)
