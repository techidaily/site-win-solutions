### Fix 1: Scan and repair your game files

 One possible cause of the crash is that certain game files are**corrupted or missing** . You need to make sure all the game files are intact and up to date. To do so, you can run a scan to verify the integrity of game files.

Hereâ€™s how to do that on Steam:

1. Go to your Steam library. Right click**Subnautica: Below Zero** and select**Properties** .

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Some players reported that**updating the graphics driver** could improve the performance of Subnautica and stop the crash. So if you donâ€™t know whether youâ€™re using the latest GPU driver, have a check or just go right ahead and do an update.

 You can update manually, by visiting the manufacturerâ€™s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), searching your model and downloading the latest correct driver installer. But if you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to do it manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you donâ€™t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 3: Perform a clean boot

 Given that we all have different setups, itâ€™s also likely that some programs might be interfering with the game. To verify, you can perform a clean boot. It allows your computer to start**with only essential services and programs** .

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.

6. Restart your PC.

 Now you can play and see if the game crashes again. If it doesnâ€™t, repeat these steps but only disable half of the programs and services.

If this trick doesnâ€™t help, you can move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Limit CPU cores for Subnautica: Below Zero

1. First open Subnautica: Below Zero.
2. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl+Shift+ESC** to open Task Manager. Then navigate to the**Details** tab. Right click**Subnautica.exe** and select**Set affinity** .

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 Overclocking is not something new in 2021, basically every motherboard and graphics card has this gimmick. But when youâ€™re enjoying this zero-cost performance booster, beware of the side effect of making your system unstable. So if youâ€™re using overclocking software, such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Intel Extreme Tuning Utility** (Intel XTU), or youâ€™re using a BIOS setting to overclock, disable it and test the gameplay again.

 You might also need to disable hardware monitors like AIDA64 and NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
