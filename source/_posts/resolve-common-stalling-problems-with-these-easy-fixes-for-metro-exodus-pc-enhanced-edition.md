| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel CPU Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz / AMD CPU Phenom II X4 940 |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB                                                      |
| **Storage**    | 80 GB                                                     |
| **DirectX 12** | 12                                                        |

| **Storage**    | 80 GB                                                       |

## Fix 2: Allow Hitman 3 through firewall

 Windows firewall and anti-virus software are intended to protect your computer from malware attacks. However, there’s a possibility that your game is perceived as viruses and they stop it from booting up. In this cause, you need to make sure the firewall is not blocking your game. Follow the steps to do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key to open the Start menu. Then type in

**windows firewall** and click **Windows Defender Firewall**  from the results.

![Windows Defender Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows-firewall-1.jpg)

 2) From the left panel, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .

![allow an app through windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-an-app-through-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Now you need to scroll down until you can find**HITMAN 3** . Make sure it’s ticked for Private and Public.

 If HITMAN 3 isn’t on the list, take the steps below to add the game to the list.

 4) Click**Change settings > Allow another app…** .  
  
![allow HITMAN 3 through Windows Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/allow-HITMAN-3-through-windows-firewall.jpg)

 Then browse for HITMAN 3 and follow the instructions to allow your game through the firewall.

 If you’re using other anti-virus software, make sure you whitelist HITMAN 3\. If it still didn’t help you boot up HITMAN 3 properly, try the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your device drivers, the graphics driver in particular, are important components that greatly impact your computer’s performance. When a program merely shows you a black screen, it could be a driver issue. It means you’re using outdated or faulty graphics driver. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now as it may help you fix the issue without hassles.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you are not familiar with computer hardware, and if you don’t have the time to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically recognizes your system and finds the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how to update drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

## Fix 4: Verify integrity of game files

 If Hitman 3 has missing or corrupted files, it may not boot up correctly. To check if this is the culprit, you’ll need to verify the game files.

Here’s how to do this:

1) Open your Epic Games Launcher.

2) Under the**LIBRARY** tab, look for**HITMAN 3** and click on the**three-dots** icon. Then select**Verify** from the drop-down list.

 The verification process might take awhile. Simply wait until it’s complete and see if the issue has been resolved. If not, proceed to the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Try a different display mode

 Some players reported that there are some issues with the PC and the game running in the default display mode. To get past the black screen, trying a different mode before hitting the**PLAY** button could help you fix it.

Here’s how:

 1) When you click on the game to start up, you should be presented with an option screen showing exactly what you can do before the actual game boots up. Simply click on the**OPTIONS** button.  
  
![try a different display mode](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/full-screen-mode-options.png)

 2) In the**Display Mode** section, select a different display mode to test which one helps you fix the issue.

![try a different display mode in HITMAN 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/try-a-different-display-mode.png)

 If you’ve tried the other display modes but the game still just shows you a black screen, try the next fix below.

## Fix 6: Disable unnecessary programs

 Sometimes, the programs running in the background can interfere with Hitman 3\. What’s more, some of them, such as Media Players and web browsers have been constantly using the resources that possibly trigger the black screen in Hitman 3.

 So we suggest you end programs that you don’t need to be running when playing the game. But be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly.

Here’s how to disable programs in Task Manager:

 1) Right-click on the taskbar. Then select **Task Manager** from the list of options.  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/task-manager-from-the-taskbar-1.jpg)

 2) In the **Processes** tab, check the programs that are using more CPU from the list. Then right-click on those programs and select **End task** .  
  
![check cpu usage and end the tasks that are using more cpu](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-cpu-usage-and-end-the-task.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) In the **Startup**  tab, you can additionally prevent some programs from starting up on system boot. This will lower your overall cpu usage when using your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After you’ve done these, try to launch Hitman 3 and you should be able to load into the game.

 Hopefully, till the end of this post, you’re able to boot up Hitman 3 correctly. For other bugs, we believe that IO Interactive will roll out updates that will make the game run smoother on PC.
