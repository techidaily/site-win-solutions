1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Rollback](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  the graphics driver
3. Update DirectX

9. **[Reinstall Riot Vanguard](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 You will get this error message**Graphics driver crashed** if the driver is outdated, corrupted, or incompatible, so you should try updating the graphics driver, especially when you haven’t done so for a while.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1 – Manually

 Since Windows Update and Device Manager won’t always deliver the latest graphics driver ([learn why?](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), you can download the latest**game ready driver** from the manufacturer’s website (be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10), and update the driver manually.

* [**NVIDIA**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

**Note:** Please uninstall the graphics driver first to make sure you’re using the right driver when you update a driver manually.

### Option 2 – Automatically

 Manual updating a driver is always time-consuming. Fortunately, though, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You can update the driver either with the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.

 With the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,** it takes just 2 clicks, and you get full technical support and 30-day money back guarantee.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  Driver Easy.

 2) Click the**Scan Now** button, and it will automatically recognize your system and all your devices and install the latest game-ready graphics driver for you, along with your mouse driver, keyboard driver, sound card driver, etc. – direct from the manufacturer.

 If updating to the latest driver didn’t do the trick, you can also perform a Windows Update since the latest graphics driver is designed for the latest Windows version.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Roll back the graphics driver

 If the error**Graphics driver crashed** happens and your Volorant keeps crashing after a graphics driver update, you should roll back to its previous version.

 You can roll back the graphics driver via Device Manager ([see how](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), but if the**Roll Back Driver** option is grayed out, you can download an older version of the graphics driver from the manufacturer.

* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us)**  
  * See all previous versions and download the second latest driver.
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-19-12-1)**  
  * Change the numbers at the end of the link to correlate to the downloads you want to download.
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**  
  * Select the product model and the operating system. Then scroll down the list and download an older driver.

## Fix 3: Update DirectX

 This error might happen if you’re using an outdated version of DirectX, which causes problems when your Valorant is interacting with your graphics card. Here’s how to check if you’re using the latest DirectX:

 1) From the Task Bar**Search** box, type**dxdiag** , and then press**Enter** .

 2) Click**dxdiag** from the results.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Check DirectX Version on lower right corner in the first page in first page (the**System** tab).

 To upgrade your DirectX version, you’ll need to upgrade to the highest level of Windows version. So make sure you’ve performed a full Windows Update.

## Fix 4: Reset your graphics card software

 NVIDIA comes with the NVIDIA Control Panel and AMD comes with the Catalyst Control Center. Both of these programs allow users to set up graphics profiles that can override application settings and sometimes interfere with VALORANT as a result.

To fix this, you can try resetting the software to default:

### NVIDIA Control Panel

* Right-click on your **Desktop** and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** .
* Select **Manage 3D Settings** .
* Click on **Restore Defaults** .

### CATALYST Control Center

* Right-click on your **Desktop** and select **Catalyst Control Center** (also called **VISION** center).
* Select **Preferences** .
* Click on **Restore Factory Defaults** .

## Fix 5: Play Valorant in windowed mode

 If the**Valorant graphics driver crashed** error persists or the game keeps crashing after you have tried the two methods above, the culprit might be on their end. But still, you can reduce the crashes by playing the game in windowed mode:

1) Launch Valorant.

2) On the loading screen, press**Alt** +**Enter** to set the game to windowed mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Your device is not that sensitive to overclocking, but the game is, especially when you’re using third-party tools such as MSI Afterburner. This may not fix this error permanently, but it allows you to play the game with fewer crashes.

## Fix 7: Close all background apps

 Another possible cause of the error is application interference. You can press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** to open Task Manager and close all unnecessary applications.

 Since Valorant consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, some antivirus will mistake it as a potential threat. You can add the Valorant executable file to its exception list, or uninstall it temporarily.

 Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, so disabling it may not always work.

## Fix 8: Turn VSync off

 Some players find that disabling VSync perfectly fixes their Valorant crashing issue. Enabling VSync will force your game to run maximum at your monitor’s refresh rate (usually 60 Hz). In this case, you can try turning off VSync to unlock your FPS.

 If this workaround doesn’t work for you, you can try lowering your in-game settings. Go to **Settings > Video > GRAPHICS QUALITY** , and lower the graphics settings.

* Multithreaded Rendering: Off
* Material Quality: Low
* Texture Quality: Low
* Detail Quality: Low
* UI Quality: Low
* Vignette: Off
* VSync: Off
* Anti Aliasing: Off
* Anisotropic Filtering: 1x
* Improve Quality: Off
* Bloom: Off
* Distortion: Off
* First Person Shadows: Off

## Fix 9: Reinstall Riot Vanguard

 The game crashing might be caused by Vanguard. In that case, you can clean reinstall it, which has been proved helpful to many players.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** and**R key** to open the Run box.

 2) Type**appwiz.cpl** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/uninstall-app-now.jpg)

 3) Right-click Riot Vanguard and select**Uninstall** .

 4) Visit[Valorant’s official website](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) and download the game installer.
