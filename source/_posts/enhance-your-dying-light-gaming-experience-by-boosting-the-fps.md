### Fix 1: Restart your computer

 Sometimes, Dota 2 might crash or stop responding because of a temporary issue that can be fixed with a simple reboot. A restart clears off the current state of your operating system/software and helps you get rid of troublesome codes.

If Dota 2 still crashes randomly, try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Update the graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game issues (such as game crashes, freezes, and lags), is a missing or outdated graphics driver.

 You can update the driver manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it (and it uses only genuine drivers, straight from your hardware manufacturer).

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If the_Dota 2_ crashing issue persists, then move on and try the next method.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 The_Dota 2_ crashing issue is sometimes triggered by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If the game works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 4: Run the game as an administrator

_Dota 2_ may not be able to access certain game files on your computer under normal user mode, which could lead to the game crash. To fix it, try running the game as an administrator:

**1)**  If Steam is running now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-342.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-342.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Verify the integrity of game files

_Dota 2_ is likely to crash when one or more game files are damaged. So you should verify the game files to make sure any corrupt files fixed and missing files installed. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)

**3)**  Right-click **Dota 2**  and select **Properties.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-323.png)

**5)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If_Dota 2_ crashing issues happen again, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Adjust virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

_Dota 2_  is likely to crash if the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files. Follow the instructions below to adjust the size of your virtual memory and see if this is causing your problem:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-884.png)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-882.png)

**3)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-881.png)

**4)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-880.png)

**5)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/paging-file.png)

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-879.png)

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger. In most cases, setting your virtual memory as 4096M is enough.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-909.png)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-877.png)

**9)** Restart your computer and your game.

 If you still run into the_Dota 2_ crashing issue, don’t fret. Check the fix below.

### Fix 7: Set game launch options

 The_Dota 2_ crashing issue could be caused by incompatible game settings. To see if that’s the problem for you, try[**running the game with minimal video settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[playing the game with default settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

Follow the instructions below:

#### Launch your game using the -safe launch option

 The -safe launch option will cause your game to launch with minimal video settings, in windowed mode and with a 640 x 480 resolution. This can fix game crashes triggered by faulty video configuration.
