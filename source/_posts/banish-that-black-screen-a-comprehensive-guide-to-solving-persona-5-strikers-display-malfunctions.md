## Fix 2: Make Sure Your Device Meets MTGA Minimum Specs

 If the black screen issue still exists after the reboot, you might want to check your PC specifications and make sure it can handle the demands of the game. Here’re the minimum system requirements for MTGA:

| **Processor**        | AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 5600+ or Equivalent |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Graphics Card**    | GeForce GTX 8800 or Equivalent                 |
| **RAM**              | 2 GB                                           |
| **Operating System** | Windows 7                                      |

## Fix 3: Check for Connection Issues

 If your game won’t load at all and all you see is a black screen, it could be a connection issue. The first thing you want to check is the **[MTGA status page](https://magicthegatheringarena.statuspage.io/)**  . Just visit the page and see if there are any ongoing issues. If you see outages, it could be for maintenance or a temporary problem. Just wait for the developer to resolve it in this case.

 If all the servers are showing up, then the problem is maybe on your end. You can restart your network by turning off your modem and router for at least 20 seconds then turning them back on. And if you’re using a Wi-Fi connection, try using an ethernet cable as it provides a more stable internet connection.

 If your network works fine and the issue persists, then move on and try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4: Close Background Apps

 If you’re running multiple programs when playing Magic: The Gathering Arena, issues like this may occur because of software conflicts or an overloaded system. Make sure you close inessential background apps when gaming, such as your antivirus, overlay software, etc.

 If this doesn’t do the trick for you, read on and try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Download the Latest Visual C++ Redistributable

 Another fix that works for many players is to update the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. Just **[download the latest version of Visual C++ vc_redist. x86.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160)**  from the Microsoft official website and install it on your PC.

If this does fix your issue, try the next solution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Update Your Graphics Driver

 If the blacking screen issue keeps coming up, it might be that your graphics driver is not compatible or gets corrupted somehow. So you want to make sure that you’re using the right driver.

**You can manually** **check the driver for your graphics card** by going to the manufacturer’s website, such as **[Nvidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , and searching for the most recent correct driver manually. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update graphics driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/de-1.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update button** next to the video driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

4) Restart your game to test the issue.

If you still have the problem, then try the next fix below.

## Fix 7: Reinstall the Game

 If you still can’t get MTGA to work correctly, it could be an issue with game installation files. In this case, uninstalling the game then reinstalling it might help.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run command.

 2) Type **appwiz.cpl** and click **OK** .

 3) Right-click**MTG Arena** and click **Uninstall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-14_11-19-29.jpg)

 4) [**Download**](https://magic.wizards.com/) and reinstall the game.

## Bonus Tip: Use a VPN

 Gaming can take up a lot of bandwidth. To prevent network congestion, your internet service provider (ISP) may limit your connection speed to balance all connections – which can cause issues for you.

 In this case, a VPN (also known as Virtual Private Networks), such as **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can help you bypass network throttling easily! Using a VPN encrypts your data, keeps your internet activity hidden from your ISP, and allows you to bypass censorship blocks, so you can browsing the internet securely and anonymously.

 If you’re not sure which VPN to choose, we recommend **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , which is one of the most powerful and reliable VPNs and our favorite VPN. Follow the steps below to see how to use **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  :

 1) **[Download NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install it on your device.

 2) Log into your account. If you don’t have an account, follow the on-screen instructions to create one.

 3) Connect to a US-based VPN server.

4) Run your game and enjoy a better gaming experience!
