## Escaping Frustration: A Comprehensive Fix for Fortnite Error 84 - Party Connection Problems

Many Fortnite players are reporting that they get the error code 84, therefore they can’t join any friends or parties. If you don’t know what error code 84 is and wonder how to get rid of this error message, you’ll learn every possible solution in this post.

**PRO TIP:** To ensure an excellent gaming experience on PC, it’s recommended to keep your device drivers up to date, especially your graphics driver. But if you don’t have the time nor patience to update the driver manually, you can download **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and let it do all the work for you. (The[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

## Try these fixes

1. **[Check the status of Epic Games server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Submit a support ticket](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Change the skin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Change the lobby to Public](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Join friends using the](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [Epic Games list](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1\. Check the status of Epic Games server

 Sometimes you run into error codes because the servers are down. This can be a temporary situation so you can check the status of servers before you try any of these workarounds below.

* **Check the status of servers:**  
[status.epicgames.com](https://status.epicgames.com/)
* **Check their Trello board for issues:**  
[trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues](https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues)

 The downtime always begins a few days before a major update. If the services for**Parties, Friends and Messaging** are under maintenance, you can just wait for the new release, or follow their[Twitter account](https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus) to get the live status of Fortnite.

### Fix 2\. Submit a support ticket

 You may find this error code 84 annoying and want to join your friends as quickly as possible in Fortnite. If that’s your case, the quickest solution is to submit a support ticket to Epic Games.

* **Email address:**  
[epic-support@epicgames.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* **What you should include:**  
 A screenshot of the error code.
* **Tips:**  
 You’d better send them a ticket from the Epic Games app so that they can better solve your problem.

 They may help you delete the client settings file and you can join a party again. If it’s too long for the customer service to respond, you can try these workarounds below.

### Fix 3\. Change the skin

 Though it seems absurd to you, changing the skin has indeed fixed the error code 84 for some players when they can’t join their friends’ party.

1. Log out of Fortnite and log back in.
2. Click on the **Locker** tab at the top menu.
3. Select**OUTFITS** , and select any of the available Skin in your inventory. You can further customize the style if you want to.
4. Click**SAVE AND EXIT** and Fortnite will apply the Skin to your character.

 You can join a game and wait until you are in the lobby. Accept the invite to join the party and test if the error code 84 persists.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4\. Change the lobby to Public

 Another workaround you can try is to set your lobby to Public and then you can join without an invite.

 Simply head over to the lobby setting, and click the hamburger icon in the top-right, and set your**Party Privacy** to**Public** .

You can always kick unwanted guests from your lobby.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5\. Join friends using the Epic Games list

 If the invite system is down, you can bypass it by adding them to your friends’ list. This will help you get around this issue.

 But if the host of the lobby you’re trying to join is already on your friends’ list, you can skip this fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6\. Reinstall the game

 No matter where you play the game, reinstalling the game always does the trick for a few players. Consoles and mobile devices are closed systems, meaning there aren’t many troubleshooting options to fix issues you’re having. The most common fix is to reinstall Fortnite.

---

 There you have it – all the possible fixes to your Fortnite error code 84\. If you’re still experiencing the error, you can wait for Epic Games to fix this issue. They won’t keep you waiting for too long.
