Many players are reporting that they’re getting terrible lagging in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Actually, game lagging is a network issue. So when you think your Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is lagging, you should first check your network connection.

 However, some may get “low FPS” or “stuttering” issues and mistake it as a “lag” issue. So in this post, we’ll address the issues that make your Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla “laggy” altogether and help you improve the game performance on any PC.

* [2 – Reboot your network](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3 – Update the device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

* [5 – Change your DNS settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [6 – Clean all your temp files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 1 – Install the latest game patch

 It’s always recommended to check Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla game updates, and install the latest game patch to solve the issue. You can find more information about Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla[news & updates](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/valhalla/news-updates) on Ubisoft.

## 2 – Reboot your network

 First, make sure you’re using an Ethernet connection to get a stable network all the time. Then you can try restarting the network. This will help fix Internet connection problems, improve slow-moving connections.

 Since your modem is on all day, it might cause the packets you’re sending and receiving to become corrupt, thus lowering your speed. Therefore, it’s a good idea to unplug your modem on a monthly basis.

 1) Turn off everything that’s connected to the network (your computer, tablet, printer).

 2) Unplug the power cord from the back of the modem and router. Make sure all the lights on the modem/router are turned off (please don’t push the reset button).

3) Wait 1 minute, then plug the power cord back into the modem/router.

4) Wait for the Internet light to turn green.

 Now you can reconnect the Internet and launch Assassin’s Creed Valhalla again to test the issue. If the game is still lagging a lot, check the next fix below.

## 3 – Update the device drivers

 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla lagging can be caused by an outdated or corrupt network driver. According to some players, they get a smoother game after updating their network driver. So make sure you always have the latest network driver.

 To get a flawless gaming experience, it’s also important to update your graphics driver. Because your video card is the component responsible for processing visuals and sending them to your screen, any game crashing issues are typically rooted in your GPU.

There are two ways for you to update the device drivers:

**Option 1 – Manually –** To update your network driver, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s official website and search for your model. You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Note that you need to find the drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended) –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead,**do it automatically** with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network card or graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 4 – Disable VRR and V-Sync/FreeSync
