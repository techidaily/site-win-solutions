## Solution Tips for Updating Outdated Drivers in Minecraft – Get Back to Playing

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/minecraft-driver-outdated-featured.jpg)

 After the Minecraft update, many players start reporting an**Drivers Outdated message** telling that they need to update their graphics driver. If you’re on the same boat, you’re in the right place. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to get rid of this message.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that gives you luck.

1. [**Make sure you’re using the latest drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Check the versions of Minecraft and your system**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Scan and repair Windows**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Check your default GPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Make sure you’re using the latest drivers

 The message is self-explanatory: **you need to check if you’re using the latest graphics driver** . The latest video driver gives your GPU a performance boost. But unlike system updates, most of the time you need to take care of driver updates yourself.

 You can update your drivers manually, by visiting your GPU manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then searching your model and finding the latest correct installer. But if you’re not comfortable playing with computer drivers, you can update manually with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 If your PC is having persistent driver issues, we recommend you use a [third-party driver updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . A professional tool not only updates drivers on your PC, it also _fixes_  those that are either broken or missing altogether.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if Minecraft is running fine.

If the update message pops up again, check out the next method.

### Fix 2: Check the versions of Minecraft and your system

 Though the message tells you to update your graphics driver, it’s also a priority for you to **make sure both your Minecraft client and system are up to date** . Some players suggest that the message could also be telling you that you’re on an outdated client or system.

#### Verify your Minecraft version

You can use the following steps to check for Minecraft updates.

##### Bedrock edition

1. On your keyboard, press**Win** (the Windows logo key). Then click**Microsoft Store** .

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you’ve installed all system updates, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.

If you’re still seeing the message, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Scan and repair Windows

 If you’re sure it’s not a driver issue, try scanning Windows and see if it’s a system error.

 You can follow [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files-79aa86cb-ca52-166a-92a3-966e85d4094e) by Microsoft to scan manually. But if you don’t have the time or skills to do it yourself, you can give [**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) a try. It’s is a professional Windows repair tool that can scan your system’s overall status, diagnose your system configuration, identify faulty system files, and repair them automatically.

Once done, restart Windows and try again in Minecraft.

### Fix 4: Check your default GPU

 If your computer comes with dual graphics cards, for example an Intel integrated graphics and a dedicated NVIDIA/AMD graphics card, you can check if you’re**running Minecraft on the desired GPU** . The update message might appear if you’re running Minecraft on the wrong GPU.

Here’s how you can check the preferred GPU of Minecraft:

 If you’re on Windows 7 or 8, you can change the preferred GPU of Minecraft in **NVIDIA Control Panel** or**AMD Radeon™ Settings** .

1. At the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select **Display settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-1.jpg)
2. Under the **Multiple displays** section, click **Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-preferred-gpu-2.jpg)
3. Under**Graphics performance preference** , specify your app type (For Java Edition, select**Desktop app** . For Bedrock, choose**Microsoft Store app** ). Then click**Browse** and select your Minecraft launcher.
