 The Settings app is a hub for almost all of Windows 10's settings, and you'll probably find yourself accessing it pretty frequently. Luckily, there's more than one way to open the Settings app—from several different locations.

##  Use a Keyboard Shortcut

 Windows 10 is [packed full of keyboard shortcuts](https://windows11.techidaily.com/unlocking-microsoft-family-safety-potential/) to help you streamline your workflow, so it should come as no surprise that there's a keyboard shortcut to open the Settings menu.

 Just press Windows+i and the Settings menu will launch.

##  Use the Start Menu

 You can also quickly access Settings from the Start menu. First, click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of the desktop. The Start menu will open. Click the gear icon near the bottom of the menu.

![Click the Start button, then click the gear icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/start-menu-then-settings-icon.png) 

 The Settings app will open.

##  Use the Power User Menu

 The Power User menu, also known as the [WinX menu](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-poco-m6-5g-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/), is essentially the Start menu's context menu. Open it by right-clicking the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of your desktop, or use the Windows+X keyboard shortcut. The Power User menu will appear. Here, click "Settings."

![Right-click the Start button, then select 'Settings.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/open-settings-power-user-menu.png) 

 Settings will open.

##  Search for Settings in Windows Search

 You can search for any app installed on your Windows 10 PC from the Windows Search bar—including the Settings app.

 Type "Settings" in the Windows Search bar and click the "Settings" app from the search results.

##  Access Settings From the Context Menu on the Desktop

 Another quick way to access Settings is from the desktop's context menu. First, right-click anywhere on your desktop and the context menu will appear. At the bottom of the context menu, click "Display Settings" or "Personalize."
