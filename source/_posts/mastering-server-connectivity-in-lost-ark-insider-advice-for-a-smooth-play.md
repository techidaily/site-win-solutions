### Fix 1: Re-add your friend

 I believe you’ve already tried restarting Minecraft maybe even restart your computer. There is one more thing you can try: re-add your friend.

 If you find you can still connect to a stranger’s world, you can remove the person as a friend then re-add him/her back. This fix has helped some players.

---

### Fix 2: Reload your private world

 Some players have reported that after reloading their private world, they’re able to connect to their friends’ world. Somehow it works for many users on all platforms.  
 Here’s the tutorial:

1. Launch Minecraft.
2. Click**Play** .
3. Go to the**Worlds** tab and choose one of your Worlds.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2021-02-18_15-00-57.png)
4. Evoke the menu and choose**Save & Quit** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2021-02-18_15-01-51.png)
5. Back to the main menu and click the**Friends** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Disable Windows Firewall

 If Minecraft is not allowed in the Firewall, the “Unable to connect to world” issue can happen. You can connect to the internet but can’t join each other’s world. So check the Firewall settings and ensure the Minecraft executable file “javaw.exe” is allowed in the Firewall.

1. Click the Windows start button, type**control panel** and press the**Enter** key on your keyboard to open Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c.jpg)
2. Set Control Panel view by**Large icons** then click**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c2.jpg)
3. Click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3.jpg)
4. Make sure the “javaw.exe” is checked. If not, click the Change settings button then check the “javaw.exe”. If you see more than one “javaw.exe” entries, check all of them. Ensure the Private box and the Publick box are checked too.

### Fix 4: Update the network drivers

 Outdated network drivers may cause the “Unable to connect to world” issue. So you can try to update the network driver to fix the problem.

### Fix 5: Change the settings

1. Go to the[Xbox official website](https://account.xbox.com/Settings) .
2. Click the**Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Privacy** tab.
3. Find**Join multiplayer games** and make sure it’s set to**Allow** .
4. Click**Submit** .

### Fix 6: Disable antivirus software

 Some antivirus software may block some features in Minecraft so that you can encounter the “unable to connect to world” issue. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Use a VPN

 The “Unable to connect to world” issue may be caused by internet problems. It is possible these situations may interpret your connection to your friends’ world: servers are full, your area has certain restrictions that may affect the connection, etc. Then you can use a VPN service to solve the problem. VPN can bypass geo-restrictions and let you connect with the server in any place in the world directly.

 You can use the VPN you already have, if you don’t have one, it’s recommended to use [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a famous brand. Its server location covers 60 countries and the safety of this VPN is absolutely stunning. Also, it has a fast speed that can meet your needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN in your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nord.jpg)

**Coupon TIP** : Get a **[NordVPN coupon code](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  before you buy it!

 If it doesn’t work, you can contact your ISP for more information. Some players reported the ISP would block their ability to use all Minecraft servers. You need to persist and they’ll make a change.

## Bonus tips

#### For iPad users

 If you’re an iPad user who has the “Unable to Connect to World” issue, you can go to iPad Settings, Minecraft (not in the Minecraft app), and be allowed access to “Local Network”. When you back into Minecraft again, it should work.

#### For Xbox users

 Make sure your Xbox One NAT is open. Switching to a different Microsoft account sometimes helps.
