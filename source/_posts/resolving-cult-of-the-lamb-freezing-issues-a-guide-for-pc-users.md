### Method 2: Lower the graphics settings in the game

 It is possible that the game can be crashed because your graphics card cannot capable of the high settings in the game. So if you’re using an old graphics card, you can try to lower the graphics setting in the game to fix the problem.

### Method 3: Update your driver

 The outdated or missing driver can cause game crashing. You have to make sure your drivers have been updated and install correctly.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
