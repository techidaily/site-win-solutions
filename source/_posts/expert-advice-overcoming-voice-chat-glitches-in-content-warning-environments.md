### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your issue.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your issue persists, move on to the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited access to the files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how:

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-02.jpg)

**2)**  Go to the **Compatibility tab** , then check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-12.jpg)

**3)**  Click **Apply** , then **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-23.jpg)

**4)** Restart your game to see if this worked.

 If the game crashing issue continues to occur, then go ahead with Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Turn off unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time during gameplay, your PC might get overloaded and crash your game. Or, in some cases, one of your programs is conflicting with your game and causes it to fail.

 So, it’s recommended that you close unneeded programs while gaming. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_11-02-46-1024x251.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select End Task.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.
