##  Use a Microsoft Excel Family Tree Template

 Microsoft currently offers two different family tree [templates for Excel](https://templates.office.com/en-us/charts). One template is a basic three-generation family tree while the other allows you to include photos of your family members.

###  Family Tree Generator

 This [first template](https://templates.office.com/EN-US/family-tree-generator-TM89758537) includes tables for you to enter each generation into and spots for spouses. Once you enter everyone on the Family Members sheet, click "Create Family Tree" and jump to the Family Tree tab to see the finished product.

###  Photo Family Tree

 This three-generation [family tree template](https://templates.office.com/EN-US/photo-family-tree-TM88904269) allows you to add your own photos. Enter the names and birth years of each family member and use the Remove Ancestors and Add Ancestors buttons for the number of people in your family.

 To add a photo, right-click the placeholder, select "Change Picture," and find the one you want.

##  Check Out Third-Party Family Tree Templates

 Maybe you need a larger family tree that allows you to go back further than three generations. Or, perhaps you'd like a template that offers room for more details.

 Here are a few options you can check out from Vertext42 and Free PowerPoint Templates.

###  6-Generation Family Tree Template

 This [first template from Vertex42](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/family-tree-template.html) allows you to include multiple generations and photos of your family members.

 Choose the sheet you want to use for six or seven generations and then add each member of your family.

![Vertex42 6-generation family tree template](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Vertex426Generation-ExcelFamilyTree.png) 

 You can include whatever details you like below each family member's name, such as their birth year and location. To insert a photo, right-click the image placeholder, select "Change Picture," and locate the one you want to use.

###  Family Tree Template with Photos

 This [template from Vertex42](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/family-tree-template.html) features a more basic appearance but the photos are larger for a wonderful overview of your family.

 Start by adding your photos and details at the bottom and then work your way up through the three generations of branches.

![Vertex42 photo family tree template](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Vertex42WithPhotos-ExcelFamilyTree.png) 

 Again, simply right-click the image placeholders and pick "Change Picture" to include your photos.

##  Create a Family Tree From Scratch in Excel

 If you want to make your own family tree that you can customize to fit a specific number of generations, you can create one from scratch.

 Excel offers [features and tools](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-innovative-mac-screen-capture-methods-and-software-for-2024/) that make the process an enjoyable and creative one.

 Open a blank workbook in Excel and head to the Insert tab. Select the Illustrations drop-down arrow and pick "SmartArt."

![SmartArt in the Illustrations menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IllustrationsSmartArt-ExcelFamilyTree.png) 

 When the SmartArt graphic window opens, pick "Hierarchy" on the left. You'll then see a collection of [organizational charts](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/amp-up-the-sound-beat-downloads-on-fb-for-2024/) you can use for your family tree.

 You'll see horizontal charts, those with rectangles or circles, and one that uses pictures. To show an example, we'll use the Picture Organizational Chart.
