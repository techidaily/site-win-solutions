### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 You can’t expect your game to work fine if there’re files missing or broken. So first you need to**run a scan of your game folder** .

1. Open your Epic Games client and go to**Library** .

Now you can try again and see if Civ 6 launches.

If this doesn’t help, you can take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 It’s very likely that your game won’t run when you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . If you’re an avid gamer, you should always keep your drivers up to date so as to avoid compatibility and performance issues.

 You can update your drivers manually if you’re a tech savvy user: you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, then search, download and install the driver step by step. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can leave it to**Driver Easy** . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if Civ 6 works now.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t do the charm, you can check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Civ 6 has been out for several years now, so it’s possible it’ll run into compatibility issues with the latest Windows 10\. Microsoft releases system updates for Windows 10 on a regular basis. It’s important to**make sure you install all the system updates** .

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .

 Now you can try to launch Civ 6\. If it’s working this time, repeat these steps and disable only half of the services and programs to root out the offenders.

If a clean boot doesn’t help, you can check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Install the latest Visual C++ redistributable

 Some gamers reported that**installing the latest Visual C++ redistributable package** fixes the issue, so you can try the same and see how it goes.

2. Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install.

 You can also uninstall all the Visual C++ redistributable in**Programs and Features** , then reinstall them one by one. Be sure to choose the latest 64-bit installer.

### Fix 6: Switch your DirectX version

 According to some,**running Civ 6 on another version of DirectX** might be a potential fix. Normally you’re prompted to select the DirectX version at startup. But you can also use the .exe file directly. By default, you can the .exe files in _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Sid Meier’s Civilization VI\\Base\\Binaries\\Win64Steam_ . Use_CivilizationVI\_DX12.exe_ for DirectX 12 and_CivilizationVI.exe_ for DirectX 11.
