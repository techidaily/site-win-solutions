The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.
