 Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements to run the game, then move on to the fix below.

### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 An incompatible graphics driver is one of the most common causes of game issues, such as the game freezing, lagging, and crashing.

 If_Borderlands 3_ freezing issue occurs after updating your graphics driver, it is either because the latest version of the driver is not compatible with your game or because the driver is not properly installed on your PC. If it’s the first case, **[rolling back your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to the previous version should fix your problem.

 If rolling back your graphics driver didn’t help, or you haven’t updated your graphics drivers for a long time, you should **[update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to the latest version.

#### Roll back your graphics driver

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**device manager** . Then, click**Device Manager** .

#### Update your graphics drivers

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_11-43-32.jpg)

**3)** Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_11-43-38.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**4)** Try launching your game.

 If your problem continues to occur, then go ahead with the next fix below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-13-35.jpg)

 Restart your computer and your game after the update is complete. If the freezing issue happens again, try the fix, below.

### Fix 7: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when running_Borderland 3_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, the game could easily freeze or crash.

 To fix it, apart from upgrading your RAM, you can also increase your virtual memory. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings** . Then, click **View advanced system settings.**
