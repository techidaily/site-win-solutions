 What's great about charts and graphs is that they can tell a clear story about your data. So many times, you don't need to share an entire spreadsheet to show your sales, [income and expenses](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-diving-into-the-depths-with-gopro-hero5-for-2024/), or household budget.

 By simply saving the chart as an image in Excel, you can do with it what you like. Send it in an email, plop it into a text message, or [plaster it on social media](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/file-sharing-solutions-beyond-sharex/).

 When the Save as Picture window opens, select the location where you want to save the image. Then, give your picture a File Name. You can also use the "Save as Type" drop-down box to choose the image format such as [PNG](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/pioneering-your-way-up-on-youtube-26-key-strategies-for-2024/) or [JPEG](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-scholarly-screening-top-10-educational-equipment-to-preserve-lectures-for-2024/).

##  Saving Charts as Images in Excel for the Web

 The above instructions work in Microsoft Excel on both Mac and Windows. Unfortunately, [Excel for the web](https://www.office.com/launch/excel) doesn't currently offer this ability. One option is to copy the chart by right-clicking and selecting "Copy," and then paste it into another application.

 If the application you're using doesn't accept the chart as an image, another option is to capture a screenshot of the chart in the Excel sheet.
