### Fix 1: Close those unnecessary tabs

 You may run into the Chrome slow issue if**you’ve opened too many tabs on your Chrome** . Since**in Chrome, each tab opens its own process** on your PC. These tabs will consume lots of resources, which will trigger the Chrome slow issue.

 If you want to know more information about how many resources your chrome consumes, you just need to open**Task Manager** by pressing**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time on your keyboard. You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open**Task Manager** .

 So,**close those unnecessary tabs** to see if the Chrome slow issue persists. If this issue reappears, try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Disable the Chrome apps and extensions you don’t need

 The apps and extensions on your Chrome can also consume lots of resources when you’re surfing the Internet on Chrome. Try disabling the apps and extensions you don’t need any more to see if this issue persists. Here is how to do it:

1. On your Google Chrome, click**the** **menu button** in the upper-right corner. Select **More tools > Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap25-4.jpg)
2. **Turn off** **the toggle** on the lower-right corner of the Chrome apps and extensions you don’t need any more to disable them.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap26-1.jpg)

 After disabling some Chrome apps and extensions, hopefully you should notice a difference in speed on your Chrome. If this fix fails to resolve the Chrome slow issue, don’t worry, there are more fixes for your to try.

### Fix 3: Enable the prediction service on your Chrome

 The prediction service on your Chrome is a feature that allows Chrome to predict your actions ahead of time so that it can speed up the page load times. Check if you enabled this feature, if not, follow the instructions below to enable it:

1. On your Google Chrome, click**the** **menu button** in the upper-right corner. Select **Settings**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap27-1.jpg)
2. In the search bar, type**prediction** and then**turn on the toggle** next to**Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap28-1.jpg)
3. Reopen your Chrome.

 See if this issue reappears. If not, you’ve fixed this issue. If the issue persists, try clearing your old stuck browser data.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Clear your old stuck browser data

 This annoying issue is also probably caused by the cache and history data on your Chrome. So it is suggested that you **clear the browsing data on your browser** . Here is how to do it:

 **This operation will clear all your browsing history, passwords and preferences on your browser** . And you will need to re-enter your passwords and re-adjust your preferences when you access all websites you have visited.

1. On your Chrome, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Delete** on your keyboard at the same time. A data clearing window will pop up.
2. Set the time range to**cover from when you started to use your browser till now** .

### Fix 5: Disable hardware acceleration

 Enabling**hardware acceleration** allows your browser to rely on the GPU, not solely the CPU to render web pages. In the most cases, it will speed things up. But sometimes hardware acceleration can bring about unexpected issues. So, try disabling hardware acceleration on your browsers to see if the Chrome slow issue persists. Here is how to do it:

1. On your Google Chrome, click**the** **menu button** in the upper-right corner. Then select **Settings**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap31-1.jpg)
2. In the search bar, type **hardware** . Then   **turn off the toggle**  next to the feature **Use hardware acceleration when available**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap42-1.jpg)
3. Reopen your Chrome.

 See if the Chrome slow issue is resolved. If not, try resetting your browser settings.

### Bonus Tip: Update your network driver

 If the network driver on your PC is missing or outdated, it may also cause the Chrome slow issue. Try updating your network driver to see if the Chrome slow issue persists.

 There are two ways to update drivers: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Manually update your drivers**   – You can manually update the network driver by **searching the correct driver**   that is matched with your **Windows**  **OS**   on the **manufacturer’s website** , and **install**   it on your computer.

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

You can update your drivers automatically with either **the FREE**  or **the Pro version**   of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
