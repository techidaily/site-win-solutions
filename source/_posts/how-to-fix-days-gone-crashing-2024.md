 Once you’ve confirmed your rig meets the requirements, move on to more fixes advanced.

### Fix 1 – Stop overclocking

 You may expect that overclocking your CPU and GPU can give a boost in the game performance, but it sometimes comes at the cost of system stability. To fix Days Gone crashing, try **turning off overclocking utilities** like MSI Afterburner and **setting the clock speed back to the default** , and then see how things go. If the problem persists, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is important to your gaming experience with Days Gone. If the graphics driver is wrong, faulty or outdated, you may get constant crashes during the gameplay. So, make sure your graphics driver is up to date. If not, definitely update it right now.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
