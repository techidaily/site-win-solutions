### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Some applications can interfere with your Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, especially your antivirus software. To check if this is the cause of ‘Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous not launching’, you can temporarily uninstall your antivirus software because simply disabling it might not work.

### Fix 6: Change the GPU priority

 If you have multiple GPUs installed, you might as well try changing the GPU to the dedicated card to see if this helps.

 1) Right-click on any empty area of your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .
