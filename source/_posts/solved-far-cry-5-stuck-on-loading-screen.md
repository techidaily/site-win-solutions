 Directly launch the exe file to see how it works. If it still doesn’t start properly, try**running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8** . This is a simple workaround for many players.

Still no luck? Move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Allow your game through Controlled Folder Access and antivirus

 It’s also possible that Windows Security and other antivirus have prevented Monter Hunter Rise from running, and therefore the game fails to launch. To tweak the settings, follow the steps below:

1. On the Windows search box, type**windows security** and select**Windows Security** from the results.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game bugs or not launching is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . A driver update can tackle compatibility issues of new games like Monster Hunter Rise and offer a zero-cost performance boost. So before you try anything more complicated, check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 You can update the GPU driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and downloading the latest driver corresponding with your system. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amd-6800xt.jpg)

 Once done, restart the computer for the changes to take effect. Then test if the issue reoccurs. If yes, there are a few more fixes below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Disable resource-hogging programs

 If too many resource-hogging applications are running in the background, that may interfere with your game and make it crash or not open. It’s better to close these applications while playing Monster Hunter Rise. Here’s how:

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
2. Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what apps are consuming your resources most. Then right-click the process you want to end and select **End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-3.jpg)

Check if the game launches as expected. If not, take a look at Fix 5.

### Fix 5 – Verify the integrity of game files

 To troubleshoot any missing or damaged game files that might cause MHR to malfunction, you could perform an integrity check. Newly-released games keep rolling out patches, and doing this will also check for the game updates.

1. Open Steam and go to**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. From the game list, right-click**Monster Hunter Rise** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1.jpg)
3. Select**Local Files** from the left pane and click**Verify intergrity of game files** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

 It may take a few minutes to finish scanning and repairing. Then you can restart the game to see if the problem persists. If so, continue to the last method.

### Fix 6 – Repair your system files

 Besides the game files, missing or corrupted system files can also lead to various kinds of PC problems including game crashes. To check if there are critical system issues that cause Monster Hunter Rise not to launch or go black, you should run a quick and thorough scan with**Fortect** .

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a powerful Windows repair solution with a range of functions. It can not only deals with hardware-related issues, but also detect any security threats like viruses or malware, and improve your PC’s stability.
