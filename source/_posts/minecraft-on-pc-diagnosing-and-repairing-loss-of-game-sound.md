<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 1: Disable Discord Overlay

 Many users are reporting that Discord overlay can cause Minecraft not to respond. To fix it, you need to**disable Discord Overlay** or**close Discord completely** .

**Note** : Before getting started, you need to press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** at the same time to open**Task Manager** , and close Minecraft and other unnecessary apps.

 1) Open your Discord, and click the**settings** icon.

 2) Select the**Overlay** tab, and turn off**Enable in-game overlay** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/discord-overlay.jpg)

3) Launch your Minecraft again.

 See if the issue still persists. If your Minecraft is still not responding, you can move on to the next fix.

---

### Fix 2: Remove incompatible software

 Norton anti-virus software is known to cause issues with Minecraft. It can be a little too protective and will block things you don’t want to block even when you’ve disabled it. You can install the software or replace it to avoid bumping into the same problem.

 Many other applications are incompatible with Minecraft, and you can visit Minecraft’s official website for **[Known Incompatible Software](https://minecraftirc.net/support-articles/known-incompatible-software/)**  to get more information.

 If you’ve removed all these conflicting applications but your Minecraft is still not responding, you can try the next fix.

---

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 Minecraft not working can be caused by outdated or corrupt device drivers, especially your graphics card driver. Graphics driver allows your computer to display the game correctly.

 However, it’s not always only about the graphics driver, and the culprit may lie in the old sound card driver or network adapter driver. In that case, you need to update the graphics driver along with other possible drivers to make your Minecraft running again.

 There are 2 ways for you to update the driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Updating your driver manually through Device Manager or downloading the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website can be a time-consuming process, so you can choose to update all of your drivers automatically.

#### Option 1\. Manually update the graphics driver

 Make sure you’re running the latest Windows version. However, Windows Update won’t find the latest graphics driver for you for stability concerns, so you’ll need to find the correct & latest graphics driver from the manufacturer’s official website and install it manually.

* [AMD driver downloads official website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

#### Option 2\. Automatically update the driver (Recommended)

 If you are not familiar with playing around with drivers, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your computer.

### Fix 4: Run Minecraft as administrator

 Minecraft may not be able to utilize all the resources because of restricted access. So you need to run Minecraft as an administrator to see if this fixes your issue.

 1) Navigate to the main directory where Minecraft is installed and locate the main game executable.

 2) Right-click the executable file and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/properties-1.jpg)

 3) Select the**Compatibility** tab and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and then**OK** .

### Fix 5: Disable Mods

 Mods enable you to have a better experience when playing Minecraft. However, mods can be the cause of your Minecraft not responding issue. If you’ve added any mods to your Minecraft, you can disable them to fix the issue.

 You can disable mods via game launchers such as Twitch and Forge. Or you can add**.disabled** to the end of the mods’ filename, or move the mods folder from the Minecraft directory to another one. Thus you can always enable the mods by deleting the**.disabled** suffix or moving them back.

 Don’t forget to restart your computer before you play the game again.

---

### Fix 6: Reinstall your Minecraft

 If none of these fixes above works for you, you may need to try reinstalling the game to solve this problem.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**appwiz.cpl** and press**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Right-click**Minecraft** and select**Uninstall** .

 4) Press the Windows logo key and R again to open the Run box again, then type**%appdata%** and press**Enter** .

 5) Right-click the**.minecraft** folder and select**Delete** to make sure you’ve deleted the related files.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/remove-minecraft-1.jpg)

 4) After uninstalling, restart your computer. Go to the[**official Minecraft website**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) to download and install Minecraft again.

Normally, Minecraft can work properly again after you reinstall it.
