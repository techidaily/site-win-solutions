 Do you no longer need a table in your Microsoft Excel spreadsheet? If so, you can use one of two methods to remove a table from your spreadsheet. We'll show you how.

 Keep in mind that removing a table deletes all your table data.

##  How to Delete a Table in Excel With a Keyboard Key

 To quickly delete a table in your spreadsheet, use a key on your keyboard.

 First, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. In the spreadsheet, select the entire table which you want to remove.

 While your table is selected, press the Delete key on your keyboard. Excel will remove the selected table from your spreadsheet.

 To quickly restore a deleted table, press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac).

 Another way to delete a table in Excel is to use the built-in "Clear" option.

 To use this method, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. In the spreadsheet, select the entire table that you want to delete.
