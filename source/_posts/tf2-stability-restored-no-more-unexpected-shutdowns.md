_**Football Manager 2020 (FM20)**_ constantly crashes your PC? You’re not alone! Many players are reporting it, but the good news is that you can fix it. Here are 5 solutions to try.

## Fixes to try

 You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way through the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Verify the integrity of your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check for Software conflicts](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Delete the Preferences and/or Caches Folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall your game and/or Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your games or multimedia programs.

 Whether you choose to update your graphics driver manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_12-00-59-2.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 If your issue persists after updating your graphics driver, move on to the next fix.
