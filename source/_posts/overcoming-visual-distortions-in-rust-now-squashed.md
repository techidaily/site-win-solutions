## Overcoming Visual Distortions in Rust - Now Squashed

Are you troubled by the Rust graphic errors or visual glitches? Some of the gamer’s Rust is too bright to play, some gamers have weird blue hands at night. If you don’t know how to fix these graphic errors or visual glitches, this post may help.

#### Make sure your PC meets the minimum system requirements

 Before trying any fixes, make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements. Otherwise, you’re likely to run into game issues like freezing, lagging, and crashing.

Minimum system requirements:

| **OS:**        | Windows 7 64bit                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core i7-3770 / AMD FX-9590 or better |
| **Graphics:**  | GTX 670 2GB / AMD R9 280 or better         |
| **Memory:**    | 10 GB RAM                                  |
| **DirectX:**   | Version 11                                 |
| **Storage:**   | 20 GB available space                      |

## Try these fixes

1. [Update your graphic driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Turn off new screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify the game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Reinstall Rust](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Update your graphic driver

 When problems that are related to graphics happened, the first thing you should do is updating your graphic driver. Because most of the issues are caused by missing or outdated graphics drivers.
 Try updating your driver to see if that’s the problem for you. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the **manufacturer’s website**  for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**4)**  Restart your PC and Rust after the update is complete.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

If the Rust graphic error persists, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 2: Turn off new screen effects

 Changing the in-game settings will make the game look better.**Remove all of the new screen effects** . They are the culprit of the weird colors on the game. If you want to improve the graphics quality, follow the steps below.

**1)**  Launch the game and jump into the**OPTIONS** .

**2)**  Turn**FIELD OF VIEW** way up. Set**MAX GIBS** around 1000\. Turn off blood in the options.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png)

**3)**  Head to**GRAPHICS** . Set**GRAPHICS QUALITY** as below. You’ll see the quality of the game would be highly improved.

### Fix 3: Verify the game files

 When Rust has corrupted files, you can’t run Rust correctly. You can verify the integrity of Rust files from Steam. (Steam will fix corrupted files automatically if it detects any.)

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)

**3)**  Right-click **Rust**  and select **Properties.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png)

**4)**  Click the **LOCAL FILES**  tab, and then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-795.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**5)** Relaunch Rust to see if your problem has been resolved.

If it’s not working, try the next fix.

### Fix 4: Reinstall Rust

 Reinstalling Rust is very likely the last solution to the game graphic errors. This method will wipe all the game files completely and then install the brand new game.

Follow the steps below:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)

**3)**  Right-click **Rust**  and select **Uninstall.**
