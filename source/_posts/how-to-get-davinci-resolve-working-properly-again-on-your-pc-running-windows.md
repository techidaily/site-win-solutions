## Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the specs

 Before you can get started playing Death Stranding, you need to check whether or not your PC is well-equipped to handle the game at the quality within your expectation.

| **OS**         | Windows 10                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel CoreTM i5-3470 or AMD RyzenTM 3 1200        |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB RAM                                          |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce GTX 1050 3 GB or AMD RadeonTM RX 560 4 GB |
| **DirectX**    | Version 12                                        |
| **Storage**    | 80 GB available space                             |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible                                |

MINIMUM System Requirements

| **OS**         | Windows 10                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel CoreTM i7-3770 or AMD RyzenTM 5 1600   |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB RAM                                     |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB or AMD RadeonTM RX 590 |
| **DirectX**    | Version 12                                   |
| **Storage**    | 80 GB available space                        |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible                           |

RECOMMENDED System Requirements

 You can learn from the tables above that the DirectX version must be**Version 12** . Users with lower DirectX versions are experiencing more crashes while playing Death Stranding. So to better ensure you have the right DirectX version installed, you should take two steps below:

### Step 1: Check your DirectX version

 If you have no idea which version of DirectX you’ve installed, here’s how you can check:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to invoke the**Run** dialog box.

 2) Type**dxdiag** and press**Enter** to launch the**DirectX Diagnostic Tool** .

![launch DirectX Diagnostic Tool](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dxdiag-Run-box.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Under the**System** tab, look for the DirectX version listed.

![Check DirectX Version ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DirectX-12-3.jpg)

 If your DirectX is not Version 12, take**step 2** to update it.

### Step 2: Update your DirectX version

If your DirectX is not Version 12, you should update it.

 1) Go to the Microsoft DirectX[download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .

 2) Scroll down and in the**DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer** section, select your language and click**Download** .

![download DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOWNLOAD-DirectX-12-2.jpg)

 3) Once the download is completed, click on the**dxwebsetup.exe** file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

 4) Now restart your computer.

 When you’re sure that your PC perfectly meets the system requirements but the game just keeps crashing, you should try the methods listed in this article.

## Fix 2: Allow your game through the firewall or disable anti-virus software

 Windows Firewall or antivirus software is developed to detect and remove computer viruses. But there are situations when they fail to grant the authority to legitimate applications like your games. So if it happens to you, you should allow your game through[Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and disable your[antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) temporarily.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Video games are graphics-intensive. If your game keeps crashing, the possibility is that your graphics driver is corrupt or outdated. In this case, you need to update your graphics driver as your problem could be solved immediately.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/death-stranding-crashing/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the drivers manually

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

 If you’re an Nvidia user, you can also update your driver from the[Geforce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) application. What’s more, Death Stranding is one of the games that can take advantage of[optimal settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/games/) .

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

## Fix 4: Clear temp files from your PC

 Temporary files, sometimes referred to as_temp files_ , are only needed to exist temporarily while in use. They consume some disk space, which can slow down your computer or even cause a crashing issue when you’re playing games. So you can delete them and it shouldn’t cause any problems.

Here’s how you can do it:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together on your keyboard to open the**Run** dialogue box.

 2) Type**%temp%** and press**Enter** .

![delete temp files Death Stranding crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files-2-2.jpg)
