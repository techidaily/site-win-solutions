### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves. If you have an outdated network adapter driver, you may encounter various network issues such as disconnect from an online game. This may not the fix for a specific problem, but it’s no harm to upgrade your driver to make your PC work efficiently.

 You can manually update your driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website or do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

2. Type**cmd** and press the**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** key to run as administrator.
3. Type`**ipconfig /release**` and press**Enter** .
4. Type`**ipconfig /flushdns**` and press**Enter** to flush the DNS cache.
5. Type`**ipconfig /renew**` and press**Enter** to renew the IP configuration for the active adapters.
6. Close the Command Prompt and reboot the game to check.
