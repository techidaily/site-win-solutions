### Fix 3 – Launch the DXSETUP.exe file

 If L.A. Noire doesn’t launch the right way and a DirectX error appears, the corresponding solution is to launch the DXSETUP.exe file and install DirectX 9.

**1)** Launch**Steam** , and click the**Library** tab.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-0-1.jpg)

 Follow the wizard to complete the installation, and the DirectX error that stops L.A. Noire from launching should be gone. If the problem reoccurs, go to the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Opt out of all beta programs

 Game developers usually release Beta version before an official update is available. However, they can contain bugs and even cause the game instability. So if you’re participating in the Steam beta, try opting out so that L.A. Noire can launch in the normal version.

**1)** Launch Steam. Then, select the**Steam** tab at the upper left corner and click**Settings** .

<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg)

**2)** Click**Account** and click the**Change** button under Beta participation.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.jpg)

**3)** Select**NONE – Opt out of all beta programs** from the drop-down menu under Beta participation and click**OK** .

### Fix 6 – Update your graphics driver

 Wrong or outdated graphics driver can trigger various gaming annoyance and completely ruin the playing experience. To make your games run perfectly all the time, you need to install the up-to-date graphics driver.

 You can visit the GPU manufacturers’ websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  to download the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
