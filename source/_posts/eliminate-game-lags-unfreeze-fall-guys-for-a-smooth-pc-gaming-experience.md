## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 To see if that’s the cause of the_GTA5_ freezing problem, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select**End Task** . Specifically, if you have the Riva Statistics software or MSI Afterburner, try turning them off when you’re gaming to see if the issue persists.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

**4)** Relaunch_GTA5_ to test your issue.

 If your game still won’t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory** is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running _GTAV_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you don’t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If that’s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .

**2)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-35.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-31.jpg)

**4)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-27.jpg)

**5)** Click your **C drive** .

**6)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .
