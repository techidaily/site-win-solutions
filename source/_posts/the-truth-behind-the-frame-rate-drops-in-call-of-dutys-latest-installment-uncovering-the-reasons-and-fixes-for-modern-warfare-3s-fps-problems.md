1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open**Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click**Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of**CPU** or**memory** , then click**End task** to close it.  
![Close CPU memory hogging applications](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Close-CPU-memory-hogging-applications.jpg)

## Fix 6: Check for overheating components

 Premiere Pro utilizes both CPU and GPU to perform heavy computations. If Premiere Pro runs on your computer for a long time, your computer may get overheated, especially when its cooling system is not working properly. Once your computer got overheated, Premiere Pro may crash without warning. If it’s the case, you need to cool your computer down.

To cool down your computer, you may need to

* **Clean the dust** from the fans and vents of your computer.
* Make sure your computer is in a**cool environment.**
* Use a**better cooling system** for your computer if yours is not powerful enough.

## Fix 7: Update / reinstall Premier Pro

 If none of the fixes works, try updating / reinstalling Premier Pro. Normally, after updating Premier Pro to the latest version, or reinstalling it, you’ll fix the crashing issue.
