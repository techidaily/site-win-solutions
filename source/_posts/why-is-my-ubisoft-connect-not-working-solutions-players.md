2. **[Adjust sound settings on your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke Settings. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working1.jpg)

3. Check if**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working8.jpg)

 Try to use the microphone on OBS again to see if it works. If not, move on to have another try.
