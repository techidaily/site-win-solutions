## How to fix OBS Mic not working?

 You don’t have to try them all. Just work down through the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Allow access to your microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Adjust sound settings on your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Modify audio settings on OBS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall OBS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 The following screenshots are taken from Windows 10, but it’s also applicable to other Windows operating systems.

## Fix 1 Allow access to your microphone

 If your computer doesn’t grant access to the use of a microphone, no app will be able to capture your voice. In other words, you need to allow your system and application to access your microphone.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke Settings. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working1.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click**Microphone** . Click the**Change** button, then make sure the**Microphone for this device** is toggled**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working7.jpg)
3. Check if**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working8.jpg)

 Try to use the microphone on OBS again to see if it works. If not, move on to have another try.
