 Before playing an intensive video game like AC Valhalla, you should make sure your setup meets its minimum requirements. Otherwise, it would be impossible to launch the game.

#### Minimum requirements – Low preset (30 FPS)

| **Operating System** | Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | Intel i5-4460 3.2 Ghz / AMD Ryzen 3 1200 3.1 Ghz                                                    |
| **RAM**              | 8 GB (Dual-channel mode)                                                                            |

| **Resolution**       | 1080p                                                                                               |
| **DirectX**          | DirectX 12                                                                                          |
| **Hard Drive space** | 50 GB (SSD recommended)                                                                             |

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla not launching is likely caused by**an outdated or corrupt graphics driver** . To avoid compatibility issues with a new title like AC Valhalla and ensure a smooth gaming experience, you should always keep the graphics driver up-to-date.

There are mainly two ways to update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended** ) – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Relaunch the game to check its performance with your newly-installed graphics driver. If the update doesn’t do the trick, go ahead with the next fix.
