### Fix 1: Check your computer specs

 The minimum system requirements need to be met to run _Borderlands 3_ smoothly; otherwise, youâ€™re likely to encounter game issues like freezing, lagging and crashing.

 Here are _**Borderlands 3**_ **â€˜s minimum system requirements** :

| **OS:**            | Windows 7/10 (latest service pack)               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:**     | AMD FX-8350 (Intel i5-3570)                      |
| **Graphics Card:** | AMD Radeonâ„¢ HD 7970 (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 2GB) |
| **RAM** :          | 6 GB                                             |

Follow the instructions below to view your computer hardware information:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog.

 If rolling back your graphics driver didnâ€™t help, or you havenâ€™t updated your graphics drivers for a long time, you should **[update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to the latest version.

#### Roll back your graphics driver

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

### Fix 7: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computerâ€™s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when running_Borderland 3_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, the game could easily freeze or crash.
