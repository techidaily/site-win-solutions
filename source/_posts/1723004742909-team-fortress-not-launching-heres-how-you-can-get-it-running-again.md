## Fix 1: Stop overclocking your GPU

 You might overclock your GPU in order to boost your game’s FPS. But it’ll lead to an increase in heat, and thus reduce the lifespan of your hardware components. So if you’ve been overclocking it, try to disable it.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers

 You might not be able to launch your games if your graphics drivers are corrupt or out-of-date. So to have a better gaming experience, have them updated.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your graphics drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Till then, try running the game. If you want to go back to the previous launch options, just delete**autoconfig** following the steps listed above.

 If this didn’t do the trick, it might be a problem related to fullscreen. Then you can type**windowed -noborder -w \[SCR-H\] -h \[SCR-W\]** in[step 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**\[SCR-H\]** and**\[SCR-W\]** are the height and width of your screen.  
 If your screen resolution is 1920 \* 1080, then the line you should type in is**windowed -noborder -w 1920 -h 1080** .  
  
 You can check your screen resolution by following these steps: 1) Right-click on the empty space on your desktop and select**Display Settings** .  
 2) In the**Display** section, scroll down to**Display resolution** .
