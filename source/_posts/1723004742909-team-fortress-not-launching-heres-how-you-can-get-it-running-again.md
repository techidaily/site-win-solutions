## Before getting started

 Before taking any attempts for troubleshooting, make sure that your PC meets the minimum system requirements in order to play the game smoothly.

| OS        | Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |

## Fix 1: Stop overclocking your GPU

 You might overclock your GPU in order to boost your game’s FPS. But it’ll lead to an increase in heat, and thus reduce the lifespan of your hardware components. So if you’ve been overclocking it, try to disable it.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers

 You might not be able to launch your games if your graphics drivers are corrupt or out-of-date. So to have a better gaming experience, have them updated.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your graphics drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics drivers

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps releasing updates for the drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official website, find the drivers that are compatible with your PC, and install them on your own.

 Here are the most common graphics drivers. Simply click the link based on your needs.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics drivers (recommended)

 If you don’t feel like updating the drivers all on your own, we recommend you use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 This method is proven to be working for many game players. So you can give it a shot by following these steps:

 1) Run Steam. Under the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on**Team Fortress 2** and select**Properties** .

![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Under the**GENERAL** tab, click**SET LAUNCH OPTIONS** .

![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-2.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067" border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

 3) When the window pops up, type**autoconfig** and click**OK** .

![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-3.png)

 Till then, try running the game. If you want to go back to the previous launch options, just delete**autoconfig** following the steps listed above.

 If this didn’t do the trick, it might be a problem related to fullscreen. Then you can type**windowed -noborder -w \[SCR-H\] -h \[SCR-W\]** in[step 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**\[SCR-H\]** and**\[SCR-W\]** are the height and width of your screen.  
 If your screen resolution is 1920 \* 1080, then the line you should type in is**windowed -noborder -w 1920 -h 1080** .  
  
 You can check your screen resolution by following these steps: 1) Right-click on the empty space on your desktop and select**Display Settings** .  
 2) In the**Display** section, scroll down to**Display resolution** .
