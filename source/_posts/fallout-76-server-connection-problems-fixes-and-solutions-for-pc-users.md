### Fix 1: Close all background apps

 One thing that might cause your Ghostrunner Fatal Error is other conflicting applications, especially your antivirus software and any programs with overlays.

 In case those background apps are interfering with your game, you can press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager and close all background apps.

 Note that**some antivirus software still works when disabled** , so you can temporarily uninstall it or add Ghostrunner to its exception list.

 Some third-party apps may be interrupting your Ghostrunner, and**Discord in-game is a known issue** . To avoid possible game crashes, you can disable Discord in-game overlay.

### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 The main reason why Ghostrunner’s fatal error happens is tied to the GPU driver. If your game crashes, won’t launch, or gives you any kinds of errors, be sure to update your graphics card driver and other drivers.

 To update a graphics driver, you can either go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest drivers. The latest game-ready drivers are always prepared for your specific games.

 Or if you don’t feel like updating the graphics driver over and over again manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Updating your game-ready graphics driver automatically is quite easy. Simply run Driver Easy, and it will recognize your system and find the correct & latest driver for it. Also, you can also update other related drivers such as audio driver, mouse driver, keyboard driver, etc.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan No** w button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 3: Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2013

 Especially when you get error codes when starting your game, try installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 (both b84bit and 64bit), which proved to be working for many Ghostrunner gamers. Here’s how to do it:

 1) Visit[Microsoft Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) center.

 2) Scroll down to the download section for**Visual Studio 2013** , and click **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013** .

4) Scroll down the page and download the x86.exe.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-2.jpg)

 5) Run these two downloaded files and follow the on-screen instructions to install.

 6) Once complete, restart your computer for it to take full effect.

Play Ghostrunner again to see if this fatal error reoccurs.

### Fix 4: Stop overclocking

 Another reason that you get Ghostrunner fatal error is GPU overclocking. If you overclocked your GPU with some software such as Afterburner, we recommend stopping the overclock or suspending these programs including GeForce Experience before you play the game.

 If the fix above doesn’t help, you can lock the game’s maximum FPS:

 1) Right-click your desktop and select**Nvidia Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NVIDIA.jpg)

 2) Navigate to the**Manage 3D Settings** \>**Program Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Select**Ghostrunner** and turn on the**Max FPS Limit** option.

 4) Set the value to**30** and it will lock the game’s maximum FPS level.

 Start your game again to see if this helps you get your game back to work.

### Fix 5: Verify game files

 Many of the errors happen because of improper installation or corrupted game files. So please make sure you have all the correct game files.

1) Open the Steam Library.

2) You can find the Ghostrunner game there, right-click on the game and click on**Properties** .
