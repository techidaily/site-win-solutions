### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 According to[some players](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackopscoldwar/comments/kiaa2w/ui%5Ferror%5F27711%5Fcant%5Fload%5Fthe%5Fgame%5Fanymore%5Fpc/) , updating the graphics driver is a potential fix to this UI error. So you need to**make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver** . If you aren’t, definitely do it now because it can save you lots of hassle.

 NVIDIA and AMD update their drivers frequently so as to guarantee the best performance on every major titles. New drivers usually include compatibility patches that can boost the GPU performance dramatically.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)
