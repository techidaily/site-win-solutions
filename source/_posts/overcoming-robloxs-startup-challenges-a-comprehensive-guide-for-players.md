## Bypassing Startup Problems with Persona 5 Strikers - A Comprehensive Fix It Up

You just jumped into the stylish world of Persona but annoyed to find that Persona 5 Strikers keeps crashing. If you’re experiencing random game crashes or crashes on startup, don’t worry. You should be able to fix it by yourself in this post.

 Before you proceed with the fixes below, please make sure your gear meets[the minimum requirements of Persona 5 Stri](https://gamesystemrequirements.com/game/persona-5-strikers) [kers](https://gamesystemrequirements.com/game/persona-5-strikers) .

## Try these fixes

 Persona 5 Strikers crashing might be caused by**lack of administrative rights** ,**corrupted game files,** or**software interference** ,**outdated graphics drivers** , etc.

 No matter what the cause is, to solve your problem quickly, you should always try the following fixes:

1. **[Close all unnecessary applications](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. [**Update your graphics drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Verify the game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Play the game in windowed mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Run your game as an administrator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Tweak some settings in NVIDIA Control Panel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Close all unnecessary applications

 Your Persona 5 Strikers may be crashed by interference from some programs running in the background.

 They include utility programs provided by your hardware manufacturers that change your components or system settings (MSI Afterburner or antivirus software, for example).

 To see if that’s the case for you, press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager and close all those programs before you run your game. Then check to see if this is able to stop your crashing issue.

 Note that some antivirus software will still keep running even when disabled. You can add your game to its exclusion list or uninstall it temporarily.

## 2\. Update your graphics drivers

 It’s very important to keep your graphics drivers updated to the latest version, whether for Persona 5 Strikers or other games. Graphics manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix known bugs and make minor improvements.

There are mainly two ways for you to update your graphics driver:

### Option 1: Manually

 To manually update your graphics driver, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s official website ([**NVIDIA**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) to download the latest driver for your operating system.

 Note that when installing a driver manually, you’ll need to perform a clean installation so that the new driver can be recognized correctly.

## 3\. Verify the game files

 To make sure there are no corrupted or missing files, you can check the integrity of the game files. Here’s how to do it:

1. Launch Steam, and go to the**Library** .
2. Right-click on Persona 5 Strikers, and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/persona-5-properties.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Wait for the verification to complete. Once done, you can relaunch your Persona 5 Strikers to test the issue.

## 4\. Play the game in windowed mode

 Another way to stop your Persona 5 Strikers from crashing is to play the game in windowed mode. Here’s how to do it:

1. Go to your Steam Library, and right-click Persona 5 Strikers > select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/persona-5-properties.png)
2. Under the**LAUNCH OPTIONS** , add**\-windowed** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/windowed-mode.png)
3. Close the game’s **Properties** window and launch the game.

 Now you will find the game stops crashing. If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. You can try the fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Run your game as an administrator

 Persona 5 Strikers may not work properly if it lacks administrative rights. To make sure your game has full access to the game files, you can run the game as an administrator and launch your game from the installation folder.

1. Navigate to your game installation folder (usually**C:/Steam Library/ steamapps/common/P5S/game.exe** ).  
 Or you can right-click the game and select**Manage** \>**Browse local files** .
2. Right-click the game.exe file, and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-10.30.23-AM.png)
3. Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check the box next to the**Disable fullscreen optimizations** , and**Run this program as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compatibility.png)
4. Click**Apply** \>**OK** .

 Now launch your game from there and see if this solved your crashing issue. If not, you can try the next fix below.

## 6\. Tweak some settings in NVIDIA Control Panel

 Some find turning off Triple Buffering and setting Low Latency Mode to Ultra help them reduce Persona 5 Strikers crashing. Here’s how to do it:

1. Right-click the desktop, and select**Nvidia Control Panel** .
2. Go to**Manage 3D Settings** \>**Program Settings** \> select**Persona 5 Strikers** from the list. If the game isn’t on the list then add it.
3. Set**Ultra** for**Low Latency Mode** and select**off** for**Tripple Buffering** .

**Note:** Turning on Low Latency Mode will potentially reduce your FPS. This mode is off by default, which NVIDIA says leads to “maximum render throughput.” For most people most of the time, that’s a better option.

 If this method doesn’t work in your case, you can revert back to its default settings.

---

 Hopefully, your Persona 5 Strikers works like a charm right now. But if none of these methods work for you, you may probably want to restart your PC and give your game a complete restart.

 If this doesn’t work after that, you can perform a clean installation of the game. Many players are still complaining about getting constant crashes, and the real fix may come with the next patch.
