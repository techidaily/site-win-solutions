### Fix 1: **Check your computer specs**

 Many players are reporting that_Hearts of Iron 4_ crashes on their PC, and sometimes this problem can be caused by your hardware. Here are the minimum system requirements to run HOI4:

| **Operating System** : | Windows 7 64-bit or newer                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** :        | Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 @ 2.66 GHz \| AMD Athlon II X4 650 @ 3.20 GHz |
| **RAM** :              | 4 GB                                                                  |
| **Graphics Card**      | ATI Radeon HD 5850 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX470 with 1GB VRAM             |

 Relaunch_HOI4_ to see if this has resolved your issue. If not, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 5: **Update your graphics driver**

_Hearts of Irons IV_ crashing issues might occur if you’re using a faulty graphics driver, or it’s outdated. To keep your game running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver at all times.

There are two ways you can get the right graphics driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.
* **[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/2019-tips-hearts-of-iron-4-crashing-issues/#d2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-203.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
