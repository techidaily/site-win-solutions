### Fix 1: Restart your computer

 Sometimes a game may crash or stop responding because of a temporary issue that you can fix by restarting your device. So before you move on and try any other fixes, restart your PC first.

 If Rocket League still crash after the reboot, read on and try Fix 2, below.

### Fix 2: **Run your game as an administrator**

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user. This means your game has limited permission to access game files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the core issue of Rocket League crashing issues, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card or GPU is the most important hardware when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver, you’re likely to run into game issues.

Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
