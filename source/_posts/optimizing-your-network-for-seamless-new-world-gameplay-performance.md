## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver, your game would probably be freezing. To enjoy your game to the fullest, you should update your graphics driver. This can make a great difference especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

### Option 2: Automatically update your drivers (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any outdated or missing drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to _your graphics driver_ to automatically download the correct driver for your computer, then you can manually install it.

OR

 Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with **full support**  and 30-day **money** –**back guarantee** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NVIDIA-RTX-2080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 If you’ve had your drivers updated and the PUBG freezing problem persists, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Disable overclocking

 If you’re using MSI Afterburner or other GPU tweaking programs, you cannot play your game smoothly. The game engine doesn’t really support cards that are overclocked. And overclocking can be causing game instability and thus the game might crash. So to fix it, you should disable it.

 Also, it’s very important to remove all those overlays, Steam, Discord, or whatever overlay you’re using. It’s usually causing some issues like freezing.

## Fix 4: Change Power Options

 Windows 10 offers a number of power plans including the new one**Ultimate Performance** for you to switch to. The plan,**Ultimate Performance** can let you fully exploit the potential of your computer. So it might resolve your PUBG freezing issue.

Here is how to enable this plan:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard.

 2) Type**powercfg.cpl** in the box and hit**Enter** .

![change power options; PUBG freezing](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-power-options.png)

 3) Under the**Hide additional plans** section, check the**Ultimate Performance** .

![change power options; ultimate performance Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-power-options-2.png)

### What to do if you don’t see the Ultimate Performance plan

 If you can’t see the**Ultimate Performance** plan on the settings, you can add it with the Command Prompt.

The steps are as follows:

 1) In the**Search** box, type**cmd** and click the icon from the results.

![change power options; ultimate performance Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-power-options-3-1.png)

 2) In the prompt, type the following command lines and hit**Enter** .

 **powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61**

![change power options; ultimate performance Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/change-power-options-4.png)

 After you successfully add the Ultimate Performance plan, go to the[settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to enable it.

## Fix 5: Delete temp files

 If your computer doesn’t have sufficient space to store the temp files, freezes would happen. So you can delete them by following these steps:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to bring up the Run box.

 2) Type**%temp%** and hit**Enter** .

![delete temp files; PUBG freezing](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/delete-temp-files-2.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3) Select all the files in the folder and delete them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After that, relaunch PUBG and hopefully, the freezing issue should be resolved.

 If the freezing issue persists, it’s high time you check if you have **corrupted, malfunctioning, and missing Windows software files** , which will cause performance issues.

 To do this, try using **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , which will automatically find, repair corrupted files, and fix system software issues. Additionally, it increases performance, stops computer freezing and system crashes as well as improves overall PC stability. With regular use, Fortect will constantly refresh your operating system which will **keep your computer running at its best** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC and give you a detailed report of your PC status. This will take a few minutes.

 3) Once it’s finished, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.

## Fix 6: Turn off VSync

 When VSync is enabled, your game might be less responsive. So you can turn it off to boost your game performance. Take NVIDIA as an example:

 1) Right-click on the empty space on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

 2) On the left pane, select**Manage 3D settings** .

 3) Under the**Global Settings** tab, select**Vertical sync** and turn it**Off** .

 After applying the changes, launch the game and test if it solves the freezing issue.
