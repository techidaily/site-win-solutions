## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Some 3rd party antivirus software would interfere with the game files, which may also crash the game.

 Try adding both the game folder and Steam (or Epic Games Launcher if you play the game on the Epic platform ) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable your 3rd party antivirus software before playing.

 Run WRC 10 and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.
