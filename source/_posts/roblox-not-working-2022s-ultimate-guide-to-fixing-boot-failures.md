## Fix 4 Modify audio settings on OBS

 The Push-To-Talk (Aka PTT) function on OBS allows you to record your voice only if you hold the PTT hotkey. Therefore, if you turn on Push-To-Talk unconsciously, it may seem OBS fails to capture your voice when you start recording with the mouse. So open OBS to modify it:

1. Click**Settings** on the bottom-right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working20.jpg)
2. Click**Audio** on the left tab. Locate and uncheck**Enable Push-to-talk** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working21.jpg)
3. Click**Hotkeys** on the left tab. Scroll down to locate Push-to-talk. If it’s displaying a key,**delete** it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working19.jpg)
4. Click**Apply** and**OK** on the bottom-right corner.

Use your microphone to check whether the problem is solved.
