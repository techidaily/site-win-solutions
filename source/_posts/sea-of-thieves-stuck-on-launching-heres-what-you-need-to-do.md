### Fix 5: Use a VPN

### Fix 6: Update your drivers and programs

 The outdated or wrong drivers for your graphics card, network card, sound card, etc. may cause problems. Updating your drivers is a good option to fix errors. This method can also provide you better gaming experience.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solvedsea-of-thieves-stuck-on-loading-screen/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 Devices keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 7: Disable incompatible apps

 Third-party applications might be the reason for the stuck on screen issue. You can try to disable apps like AfterBurner that show FPS, OSD, MSI, EVGA, etc and then restart your PC. If this doesn’t help, you can also try to disable your antivirus software like Trend Micro which has been known to cause conflicts.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
