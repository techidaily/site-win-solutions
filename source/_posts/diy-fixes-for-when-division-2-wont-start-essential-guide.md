#### Disabling Discord Overlay

1. Launch the Discord app.
2. Click the **Settings** icon, and then select the **Overlay** tab.
3. Toggle the switch to disable the **Enable in-game overlay** option.

#### Disabling the GeForce Experience In-Game Overlay

1. From the GeForce Experience app, click the**Settings** icon on the top right corner.
2. From the**GENERAL** panel, toggle the**SHARE** setting to off.

### 2\. Update to the latest Game Ready driver

 Both Nvidia and AMD’s newly released game-ready driver provides optimal support for Resident Evil Village. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, make sure you do so before trying other fixes.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* [**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
