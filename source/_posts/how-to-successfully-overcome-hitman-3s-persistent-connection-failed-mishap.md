## How to Successfully Install Minecraft on Your Windows 11 Device - Solved

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Minecraft-not-installing.png)

 Minecraft is a sandbox-style game with open online play fosters creativity, which attracts a large number of players to dive into this game. However, users start to complain that this game cannot even be installed on Windows 11\. This can be quite frustrating. If you’re on the same boat, no worries. Here we’ve put together some fixes for you to try.

 Before tweaking the settings below, we suggest you**restart your computer** . Rebooting is a troubleshooting step and quick fix to many issues by wiping away the current state of the software, flushing RAM and clearing up temporary files and processes.

 However, if a simple restart doesn’t do the trick, you can**try installing Minecraft from the Microsoft Store Library** .

## 1\. Allow Minecraft installer through firewall

 The Windows Firewall is a built-in application that protects users from internet-based threats. However, sometimes it may mistakenly prevent trustworthy software from making changes on your system. To check if that’s your case, you can manually add Minecraft installer to the list of bypassing the firewall. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left menu, select**Privacy & security** . Then click**Windows Security** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/allow-an-app-through-firewall.png)
5. Make sure Minecraft is on the list and the**Private** and**Public** options are checked. If it’s not on the list, that means Minecraft doesn’t have access and you’ll need to click on the**Change settings** button. Then follow the on-screen instructions to add the Minecraft executable file to the list.

 After applying the changes, try installing Minecraft and check if it’s working properly. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 2\. Download & install all Windows updates

 Windows updates usually fix compatibility issues and come with new features. If you encounter any errors and failures when launching a program, you should consider checking for Windows updates. Follow the instructions to do this.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + I keys**  simultaneously to open Settings.

 Then try to double-click on the downloaded package and see if you can install Minecraft now. If you’ve still having the issue, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Update your device drivers

 Therefore, you’re supposed to always make sure that your device drivers are properly updated.

 Manually updating drivers can be a harrowing and tedious process. You can instead, use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you take care of all the busy work automatically. It’s an automatic updater tool that**detects any missing or corrupted drivers** , then**downloads and installs the latest drivers** for your system. All it takes is just a few mouse clicks.

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with outdated drivers.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/scan-now-v5_7_0.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.  

 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Run Windows Store troubleshooter

 When you have any issues on your system, you can try running the corresponding troubleshooter to see if it helps detect your issues and hopefully fix them.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Scroll down and find**Troubleshoot** . Make sure you click on it.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/troubleshoot-windows-11.png)
3. Click**Other troubleshooters** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/other-troubleshooter.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/microsoft-store-apps-run-troubleshooter.png)

 Then wait for it to detect and troubleshoot your issues. If it fails to identify them, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If all else fails, it’s time you check whether you have missing or corrupted system files, which will negatively affect your system’s performance and even trigger some errors. In this situation, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to run the command sfc /scannow. But most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **Download** and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with full technical support. If you encounter any issues when using Fortect, feel free to contact their support team.

 Upon the completion of the repair, try to install Minecraft and you should be able to do it successfully.
