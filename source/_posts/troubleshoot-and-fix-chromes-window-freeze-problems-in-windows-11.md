### Fix 1: Update your graphics card driver

 If your graphics card driver is corrupted after Windows 10 updates, it may stop Chrome from working properly. To better troubleshoot the problem, you should update your graphics card driver.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics card driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics card driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebea95ea01f.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** . You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

4. Restart your computer and check if Chrome now works properly.

### Fix 2: Run System File Checker

 If some system files get corrupted after Windows 10 updates, you can run the System File Checker tool to repair those files and help unfreeze your computer. Here’s how to run System File Checker:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebf26b5a09e.png)

3. At Command Prompt, type **sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebf301acd5c.jpg)
4. It should begin running a system scan, and will take some time. When it finishes, restart your computer.

1. At the top right in Chrome, click the**three dots** \>**More tools** \>**Clear browsing data** .

### Fix 4: Disable your extensions

### Fix 5: Reset Chrome settings to default

 If Chrome conflicts with some other program on your computer, it may also cause Chrome to freeze. You can reset Chrome to its default settings to better troubleshoot the problem.

1. At the top right in Chrome, click the**three dots** \>**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebd83fd4eb4.jpg)

4. Relaunch Chrome and check. If the problem still exists, try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Disconnect and reconnect your Internet

 Some users have reported that the Chrome freezing problem may be caused by an Internet problem — when they by chance disconnected and reconnected their Internet, Chrome worked again. You can also give this a try.

1. You can simply click the**Network icon** on the taskbar, then select**Airplane mode** to**turn** it**on** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebcffb97b0e.jpg)
