1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Copy the path below and paste it to the Run dialog. Then click OK to open it.

![Run dialog](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Run-dialog.jpg)
2. Open the file**Engine.ini** in Notepad.
3. To disble Moive / Film Grain, add the following and save the file:  

` **[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0** `
4. Add the following to the Engine.ini file and save it to disable Depth of Field:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
5. If you’d like to disable all of them, then don’t add these commands separately. Do it like this:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
6. Launch the game again after you save the Engine.ini file.
