### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 If you keep running into Biomutant crashing, it’s likely that your graphics driver is faulty or outdated. To ensure a smooth gaming experience at all times, you should update the graphics driver to the latest.

There are two ways to do this:

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver that’s corresponding with your operating system from the manufacturers’ websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ), and then download the driver manually.

**Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you could click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
