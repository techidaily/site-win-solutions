### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is one of the most important components in gaming performance, especially for AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077\. If youâ€™re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, youâ€™re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 If youâ€™re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

1. Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

 If your game still wonâ€™t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory**  is basically an extension of your computerâ€™s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running Cyberpunk 2077, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you donâ€™t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If thatâ€™s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-41.jpg)
2. Click **Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-35.jpg)
3. Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .
