##  Custom Outlook Templates

 We've previously shown you how to [make basic templates in Outlook 2003](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/bypass-iphone-x-activation-lock-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/), which makes it easy to send specific information and forms to user groups in the office. Of course you can also make them in Outlook 2007 & 2010.

 Open Outlook and start a new email. Here we made an easy custom template showing user stats for the day and inserted a simple table. This will allow a user to easily enter in pertinent information for employees. Make sure to include the email addresses of the people who need to see it each day.

 Keep in mind that there might not be a Template for everything you might need to do, but you can often customize them. Once they're saved, you can continue to build them over time. Or if you're in a pinch and the boss is freaking out for no good reason, Templates can make you look like a hero.

 Templates are nothing new in Office, but if you're a beginner, using them can save a lot of time and give you some good ideas for presentations, spreadsheets, and unique Word documents.
