 Updating your graphics driver would help you fix the Stray crashing issue. There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)
