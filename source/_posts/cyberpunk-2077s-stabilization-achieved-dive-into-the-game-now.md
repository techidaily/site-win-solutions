 If you are sure your PC meets the system requirements for Cyberpunk 2077, you can skip to fixes directly. But if unfortunately not, then you’ll need to either update your hardware or play the game on another device that supports it.

### Fix 1: Verify integrity of game files

 The Cyberpunk 2077 not launching issue may occur when you have one or more game files corrupted or deleted by malware. To fix this, try verifying the integrity of game files from [**Steam**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[Epic Games](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  depending on which platform you’re on.

#### **Verify game files on Steam**

1) Run Steam.

2) Click **LIBRARY** .

5) Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If your game is still unplayable, move on to [**Fix 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### **Verify game files on Epic Games**

1) Open Epic Games Launcher

2) Click **Library** , then click the**Settings icon** next to the game.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.png)

4) Relaunch your game to test the issue.

If this doesn’t fix the issue, try the next solution below.

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable anti-virus/overclocking software

 Game launching issues could also be caused by some anti-virus or overclocking software (e.g.**Riva Statistics software, MSI Afterburner** , etc.) interfering with the launch. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable the software if you have any and check if the problem persists.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If the game is still unplayable, move on to the fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Run as administrator

 If Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t have permission for certain game files on your system under a standard user mode, it may not run properly. Try this setting to give the program the administrator privileges:

 1) Right-click the Cyberpunk 2077 desktop icon and select Open File Location.

 2) Right-click the **.exe file** and select **Properties** .

 3) Click the **Compatibility** tab and check **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08_14-34-51-1.jpg)

 If the game still won’t launch with admin privileges, then try the next solution.

### Fix 4: Update the graphics driver

 Your graphics card driver is vital to the gaming experience. If the driver is out of date, it can cause a range of issues, even if your video hardware exceeds the game’s requirements.

 So, you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the issue. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![amd 6800xt driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1.jpg)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** .

### Fix 6: Clear game cache files

 If your game won’t launch, then it may be due to an issue with game cache files. In this case, clearing your download cache can solve the problem.

* [**Steam users**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* **[Epic Games users](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Clear Steam cache** **files**

1) Run Steam.

2) On the top left corner, select**Steam > Settings** .

3) Click the**Downloads tab** .

4) Click the**Clear Download Cache** button.

5) Click**OK** .

 If you’re still having trouble with Cyberpunk 2077, then try **[Fix 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### **Clear Epic Games cache files**

 1) Exit the**Epic Games Launcher** .

 2) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key and R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box.

 3) Type**%localappdata%** then hit the**Enter** key.

 4) Double-click the**Epic Games Launcher** folder.

 5) Double-click the **Saved** folder.

 6) Click the **webcache** folder, and then delete it.

 7) Restart your computer and the game.

If this didn’t resolve the issue, then try the next fix below.

### Fix 7: Check for Window updates

 Windows updates can address bugs related to both hardware and software. So, make sure you’ve installed all the new Windows updates to keep your game running correctly. Here is how to do it:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .
