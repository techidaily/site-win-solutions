2. **Wait** for 60 seconds.
3. **Plug** the modem and router back into the power outlet. Make sure the indicators are back to their normal state.

### Fix 2: Switch to a wired connection

 If you’re using a wireless connection while playing New World, you may encounter the lag issue due to wireless interference, weak wireless signal, etc. Switching to a wired connection can help you fix the potential problem and get a stable connection. **Simply connect your computer to your modem or router with a cable.** Besides, you can disable your computer’s wireless adapter to ensure it’s not being used. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to open the Run dialog box. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .

### Fix 3: Verify integrity of game files

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. **Right-click** New World and select**Properties…** .

### Fix 6: Close bandwidth-hogging applications

 The applications running in the background could take up a high amount of bandwidth and cause lag issues in your game. So make sure you’ve closed the bandwidth-hogging applications while playing New World. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open the Task Manager.
2. Under the Processes tab, click**Network** to filter applications by their network usage, then**right-click** the bandwidth-hogging applications and select**End task** .

 Once done, try launching New World again to see if the lag issue still occurs.

If this method doesn’t work for you, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 7: Troubleshoot your firewall and antivirus

 Sometimes your Windows Firewall and antivirus can prevent certain applications from working properly. To see if that’s the case, you can try temporarily disabling your firewall and antivirus or adding the game to the exclusions list.

**To add Windows firewall exceptions manually:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**firewall.cpl** and click**OK** .

5. Once you’ve done that, make sure that New World has check marks under both the Private and Public columns.

 Steps for whitelisting the game in your antivirus vary, you can check the manufacturer’s support page for help.

 If the lag issue still occurs after disabling your security software, check out the last fix.

### Fix 8: Forward ports on your router

 If none of the fixes above helps you solve the lagging issue, you can try opening the necessary ports on your router to allow traffic between your network and game servers. This method has been proven useful for some players. So we suggest you give it a shot.

 Directions for forwarding ports are specific to the make and model of the router you’re using. If you don’t know how to do that, you can refer to the router’s manual or manufacturer’s website.

**Ports to forward for New World:**

TCP: 80, 443

UDP: 33435
