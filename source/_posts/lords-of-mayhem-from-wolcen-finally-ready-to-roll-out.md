### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 If Wolcen won’t start on your computer, it’s possible that one or more game files are corrupted and are conflicting with the game.

 Try verifying the integrity of your game files on Steam to see if that’s the core issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** .

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the Wolcen launching issue.

 To do this, you can visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer, (such as **[ AMD](<https://www.amd.com/en/support>**
**Nvidia)**  ,[**Nvidia**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  , etc.) and download the driver manually.

 But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 4: Run the game as an administrator

 Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem not starting issue occurs when the game is unable to access critical game files. So, if you’re playing the game on a standard user account, try running it as an administrator to give it high integrity access. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Exit **Steam.**

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-18_15-07-18.jpg)

**4)**  Try launching your game from Steam.

If the Wolcen still won’t launch, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If the game runs properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this didn’t work for you, read on and check the fix below.

### Fix 6: Turn off unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time during gameplay, your PC might get overloaded and cause your game to fail. So, you should turn off unnecessary programs during gameplay. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-02-14_17-10-19.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select **End Task** .
