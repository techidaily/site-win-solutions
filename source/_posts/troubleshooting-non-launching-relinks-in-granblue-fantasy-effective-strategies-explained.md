### Fix 1:**Update your graphics driver**

 One of the most common causes of the_**Overwatch black screen issue**_ is a missing or outdated graphics driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-203.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 2: Run the game as an administrator

 One quick fix to**Overwatch black screen issue** is running the game as an administrator. This is because Overwatch sometimes can’t access certain game files on your computer under normal user mode, which could result in the black screen issue.

 To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Right-click the**Overwatch icon** on your desktop and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-676.png)

**2)** Click the**Compatibility tab** and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then, click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-728.png)

**3)** Right-click the**Battle.net icon** on your desktop and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-680.png)

**4)** Click the**Compatibility tab** and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then, click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-726.png)

**5)** Relaunch Overwatch to test your issue.

 You can hopefully run the game without errors now. If the black screen error still happens when you launch the game, then go ahead with the fix below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-676.png)

**2)** Click the**Compatibility tab** , then check the box next to**Disable fullscreen optimizations** and click**OK** .

### Fix 4: Reset your in-game settings

**1)** Launch**Battele.net** .

**2)** Click**BLIZZARD** , then**Settings** .
