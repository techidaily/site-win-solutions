### Fix 1: Check Steam server status

 The first thing you should check is whether Steam servers are down for the moment. This is because occasionally, Steam would schedule maintenance for the servers to patch possible bugs and install new features. As such, the servers will be taken down.

* If the servers are indeed down, then there’s not much you can do but wait for the developer staff to do their thing and recover the servers.
* If the servers are up and running and yet the error occurs, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Restart your network devices

 Once you’ve eliminated server maintenance as a possible cause, you should start look into your own home network. It is possible that your modem & router are being overflooded with data, screeching your internet to such a halt that Steam could not connect to its servers.

Here’s how you can restart your modem & router:

1. Unplug your modem (and your router, if it’s a separate device) from the power socket.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/router.png) (a router)
2. Wait **60 seconds**  for your modem (and your router) to cool off.
3. Plug the network devices back in again and wait until the indicator lights are back to the normal state.
4. Restart your computer.
5. Launch Steam and check if the warning error is fixed. If yes, then great! If it still pops up, please head onto**Fix 3** , below.

 You can try out other ways to boost your network connection, such as moving your modem& router to a more central place in your home, use a[**WiFi Extender**](https://www.amazon.com/WiFi-6-Range-Extender-Booster/dp/B088H2FCHL/ref=sxin%5F21?asc%5Fcontentid=amzn1.osa.cb67d155-f9ef-4c53-b460-b150a3cccc6d.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en%5FUS&asc%5Fcontenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.cb67d155-f9ef-4c53-b460-b150a3cccc6d.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en%5FUS&creativeASIN=B088H2FCHL&cv%5Fct%5Fcx=wifi+extender&cv%5Fct%5Fid=amzn1.osa.cb67d155-f9ef-4c53-b460-b150a3cccc6d.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en%5FUS&cv%5Fct%5Fpg=search&cv%5Fct%5Fwe=asin&cv%5Fct%5Fwn=osp-single-source-pecos-desktop&dchild=1&keywords=wifi+extender&linkCode=oas&pd%5Frd%5Fi=B088H2FCHL&pd%5Frd%5Fr=8b06fc1b-3845-42cd-9f79-71ba04450fee&pd%5Frd%5Fw=DKebm&pd%5Frd%5Fwg=FUMuR&pf%5Frd%5Fp=9ca0c43d-5b2f-4d08-be2c-4bf20950d3e4&pf%5Frd%5Fr=3VVGWE27XNY8894YZHV6&qid=1620464270&sr=1-1-c26ac7f6-b43f-4741-a772-17cad7536576&tag=tgl0a3-20&tag=drivereasycom-20) , limit the number of devices connected to your network etc. You might also want to double check that the issue doesn’t lie with the router – if it does, you should contact your ISP for further advice.

### Fix 3: Update your network adapter driver

 The network adapter driver, which works as an interpreter between your network adapter and your PC, is essential to the proper functioning of the network adapter. If the driver is wrong, outdated or corrupt, your internet may go wonky. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 4: Flush DNS and renew your IP

 Generally, your computer automatically stores IP address and domain name system results so as to speed up subsequent requests to the same domains. But overtime, the cached information may have gone corrupt, outdated or otherwise incorrect, preventing you from connecting to the servers.

 In this case, you should flush DNS and renew your IP to make sure your computer communicates with the hosts correctly.

**To flush your DNS:**

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cmd.png)
2. When prompted for permission, click **Yes**  to run Command Prompt.
3. Type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-1.png)

To renew your IP:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cmd.png)
2. When prompted for permission, click **Yes**  to run Command Prompt.
3. Type **ipconfig /release** and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-3.png)
4. Type **ipconfig /renew** and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-1.png)
5. Launch Steam, play the game again and see if the connection is smooth and without fail. If the**Steam is having trouble connecting to the Steam servers** error persists, don’t worry. Here are a couple more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 5: Reset WinSock

 Winsock is a catalog of data that allows computer programs to access the internet. But sometimes the entries in the catalog may be incorrect or have gone corrupt, causing a network error. To verify if this is the case, you can perform a Winsock reset.

Here’s how to go about it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cmd.png)
2. In the Administrator Command Prompt window, enter**netsh winsock reset** , then press**Enter** ; then type**netsh winteep reset proxy** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/net.png)
3. Click**Close** to exit the window.
4. Run Steam and check if the server connection error is solved. If it still occurs, please move on to**Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Modify Steam properties

 According to some players, launching Steam with the TCP protocol, instead of the UDP protocol has helped them get rid of the server error. So it’s worth giving it a try and see if it solves your woe.

Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press**Esc** ,**Shift** and**Ctrl** at the same time to bring up**Task Manager** .
2. Select the **Startup**  tab, then right-click on each item and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable.png)
3. Restart your computer.
4. On your desktop, right-click on**Steam** and click**Properties** .
5. Click the**Shortcut** tab, then in**Target** field,**add a space to the end** and type**\-tcp** . Once finished, click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tcp.png)
6. Launch Steam and check if**Steam is having trouble connecting to the Steam servers** warning error has been fixed.

**Steam is having trouble connecting to the Steam servers** still happening? Please continue onto**Fix 7** .

### Fix 7: Allow Steam through Windows Firewall

 Windows Firewall is a built-in network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow the client through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow the app to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type **control firewall.cpl**  into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-1.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Allow-an-app-or-feature-through-Windows-Defender-Firewall.png)
3. Browse through the list of Allowed apps and features to see if Epic Gamers launcher is included. If not, click **Change settings** , click **Allow another app…** , then follow the on-screen instructions to add the app.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Change-settings-Allow-another-app.png)
4. Once completed, click **OK** .
5. Run the game in the Steam client and see if it can be connected to the server.

 If you have anti-virus software running in your computer, make sure you disable it temporarily too. During this time, be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download.

### If all else fails…

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above but it’s still no joy, then there is probably a server issue on Steam or Steam is currently under maintenance. You can check **[Steam server status](https://steamstat.us/)**  to see if other users report the very same connecting issue. If yes, there is little you can do except waiting until the developer staff restores the servers.
