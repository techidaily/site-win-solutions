## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphic driver is one of the most common reasons for Naraka: Bladepoint keeps crashing on PC. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Device Manager fails to detect an available update, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

## Fix 4: Repair system files

## Fix 5: Increase the virtual memory on your PC

 The developer suggests that insufficient virtual memory could interfere with the game’s performance, and lead to the crashing issue. You can check your virtual memory (paging file size) first, then configure the settings if needed.

**To check your virtual memory** :

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Paste**sysdm.cpl** in the box, then click OK.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-sysdm.cpl-.jpg)
3. Go to the**Advanced** tab, under the Performance section, click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/advanced-performance-settings.jpg)
4. Again switch to the**Advanced** tab, under the Virtual memory section, click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/virtual-memory-change.jpg)
5. Now you’ll see the paging file size on your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-07.jpg)

**To manually allocate paging file size** :

 If you want to increase your virtual memory to fix the crashing issue, or for a better gaming experience, follow the steps below:

1. UNCHECK the box of**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** , then select**Custom size** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-55.jpg)
2. Use the below formulas to calculate the values you should set:  

_**1GB = 1024 MB**_  
 _**Initial size (MB) = 1.5 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_  
_**Maximum size (MB) = 3 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_
3. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, press the**Windows key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Then type in**msinfo32** and click**OK** . You’ll find the information in the pop-up window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-msinfo32.jpg)
4. Calculate and fill in the**Initial size and Maximum size** , click**Set** then click**OK** . For example, I have 8 GB RAM, so my initial size would be 8\*1024\*1.5=12,288 MB, and my maximum size would be 8\*1024\*3=24576 MB

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)

4. Restart your PC to let it take effect.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

## Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run.

 By doing a clean boot, you can identify if any background program was interfering with Naraka: Bladepoint and causing the crashing issue.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** and**OK** .

3. Reboot your computer and launch the game. If it once again won’t crash, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ crash, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Naraka: Bladepoint.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Switch to the**Startup** tab, and**enable the first five startup items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-59-36.jpg)
3. Reboot and try launching Naraka: Bladepoint to see if it still crashes.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with the game.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.
