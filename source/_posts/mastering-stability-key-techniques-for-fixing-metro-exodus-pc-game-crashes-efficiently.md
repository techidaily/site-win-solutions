## Fix 4: Install the latest game patch

 4A Games, the developer of Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition again to see if the game crashes. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlays are handy, however, sometimes they may interfere with the game and even introduces compatibility issues, which may crash the game.

 Some gamers have proved that turning off the in-game overlay would reduce the chance of game crashing issues. If you’re using the in-game overlay, just disable it to see if the crashing issue persists.

 There’re many apps that support overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right-click on the Metro Exodus game title and click **Properties…** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. In the **GENERAL** section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable the Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-It-Takes-Two.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features, such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 See if Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition crashes after you disabled all the in-game overlays. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.
