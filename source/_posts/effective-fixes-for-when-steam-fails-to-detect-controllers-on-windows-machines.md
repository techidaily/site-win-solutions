If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Launch the game in Steam again to see if the issue is resolved. If yes, then great. If the error still pops up, please try**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5:**Run Steam as administrator**

 The fatal error may be related to issues with game installations or with Steam updates. So you can grant Steam administrator privileges so that it can run in the most optimized way. Once you’ve done that, check if the error still occurs.

Here is how to run Steam as administrator:

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .

You can check Steam or the game in question to see if there’s a new update available. Once you make sure you’ve installed the latest update of Steam and the game, check to see if the fatal error is fixed.

 Still no luck? Please try**Fix 8** , below.
