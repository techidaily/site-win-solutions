 Microsoft wants to make managing your finances easier. Money in Excel allows you to connect your financial, bank, and credit card accounts, view transactions, and budget your money. We'll help you get started!

###  UPDATE: 5/31/22

 Microsoft has [announced it will shut down "Money in Excel"](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-bifrost-betrayal-gods-at-war/) after June 2023.

##  What Is Money in Excel?

 Money is a dynamic template and add-in for Excel that you can download and start using in just a few minutes. It provides all-inclusive financial management in an application you already use daily.

 Using Money for Excel, you can do all of the following:

* Connect various financial accounts, like banks, credit cards, investments, and loans.
* Sync your accounts with just a click, and receive the latest transactions and account balances.
* View helpful charts, graphs, and tables to gain valuable insight on your spending, saving, and financial goals.
* Customize categories and use templates to tailor your experience.

 Microsoft uses a third-party company called [Plaid](https://my.plaid.com) to connect your financial services. The plug-in supports most major U.S. financial institutions. If you have any questions, just visit the [Plaid help page](https://my.plaid.com/help).

 To use Money in Excel, you simply need a [Microsoft 365](https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-console-content-psplus-or-xbox-game-pass/) Family or Personal subscription in the U.S. and the latest version of Excel 365\. You can use Money in Excel on your desktop or [online](https://www.office.com). Unfortunately, it's not currently available on mobile devices.

##  Set Up Money in Excel

 To get going, just head to the [Money in Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/06/15/introducing-money-excel-easier-manage-finances/) website, click "Download Now," and sign in to your Microsoft account. Click "Download," and then open the downloaded template in Excel. If you prefer to use Excel online, click "Edit in Browser."

##  Getting Started with Money in Excel

 The Money in Excel pane on the right of your workbook is the backbone of the tool. The tabs at the bottom are where you'll find your financial information.

###  The "Money in Excel" Pane

 To see all your connected institutions, click the "Accounts" tab. Depending on the types of accounts you connect, you'll see them listed under "Cash," "Credit," "Loans," and "Investments." There's also a link at the top to "Add an Account" if you want to connect additional services.

##  Save Your Money in Excel Workbook

 The last important part of setting up Money in Excel is to save your workbook. (Remember, the file you download from Microsoft is just a template). To do so, click File > Save As, give your new financial master a meaningful name, and then save it in your preferred location.

##  Notes on Using Money in Excel

 When you're just setting up Money in Excel, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* If you use Excel 365 on multiple platforms (like Windows, Mac, and the web), you only have to connect your financial accounts in one place. After you sign in to Money in Excel on another platform using the same Microsoft account, your connected accounts will appear. Just click "Update" if necessary.
* To [share your Excel workbook](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-step-by-step-approach-for-flawless-instagrams/), your recipient will also need to download Money in Excel and sign in to your Microsoft account.
