But don’t worry if you happen to be on the same boat. We’ve already compiled a list of all working fixes down below, just try them and get back to the field.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you hit the one that does the trick.

1. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Disable in-game overlay**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Upgrade your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

7. **[Check your DLC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
8. **[Scan and repair Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Verify the integrity of your game

 When troubleshooting game issues, first**check if your game files are intact** . This is especially true for new games as patches roll out almost every day. Verifying your game checks for the latest updates as well.

Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam client and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. Right click **Halo Infinite** and select **Properties..** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. On the left, select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files** .. and wait for the process to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-2.jpg)

Once done, restart Halo Infinite and check if the issue persists.

If this doesn’t stop the crash, take a look at the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlays like Discord and Steam allow the app or platform to track your achievements and purchases. It’s a handy feature, but there are also reports saying that it could be crashing Halo Infinite. So you can try to**disable this feature** and see how things go.

Here’s how to disable Steam Overlay:

1. Open Steam and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. Right click **Halo Infinite** and select **Properties..** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Uncheck the box before**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-overlay-2.jpg)

Now check if you can play Halo Infinite normally.

 If disabling overlays doesn’t do the trick for you, simply check out the next fix.

## Fix 3: Upgrade your graphics driver

 Game crashes tend to be graphics-related. In other words, you could be using a broken or outdated GPU driver. Gamers seemed to be the only group that’s surprised by the beta launch—the two GPU manufacturers have already rolled out the latest Halo-ready drivers. So if you don’t know if you have the latest graphics drivers, definitely check it now.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), downloading the latest correct installer, and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to do that manually, you can use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update automatically.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3090-Ti.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and check if Halo Infinite crashes again.

 If the latest GPU driver doesn’t fix your issue, you can try to[uninstall the graphics driver using DDU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and reinstall the previous versions of driver. Or you can move on to the next fixes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4: Check for conflicting programs

 According to some players, Halo Infinite doesn’t get along well with some hardware-monitoring tools. So you can check if your PC is running programs like**MSI Afterburner** and**Razer Synapse** . If you do, close them and check if that fixes the problem. Also, check if the game runs better without controllers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afterburner.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
MSI Afterburner

 If you’re sure it’s not the cause, simply continue to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Disable fullscreen optimizations

 Windows 10 comes with a built-in feature called fullscreen optimizations, which should theoretically improve performance of fullscreen apps. But some players have reported that this would sometimes crash the game. So you can try to turn it off and see if this is the issue.

1. Open your Steam client and go to **LIBRARY** . Right click **Halo Infinite** and select **Properties..** .
2. On the left, select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Browse…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-fullscreen-files-1.jpg)
3. Right click the**HaloInfinite** launcher and select**Property** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-fullscreen-files-2.jpg)
4. In the pop-up window, check the box before**Disable fullscreen optimizations** . Next click**Change high DPI settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-fullscreen-files-3.jpg)
5. Under**High DPI scaling override** , check the box next to**Override high DPI scaling behavior** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-fullscreen-files-4.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Now restart your game and check the gameplay.

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, simply try the next one.

## Fix 6: Check for system updates

 Windows 10/11 offers system updates regularly, which usually improves system stability and sometimes in-game performance. Normally it’s an automated process, but you can also check to make sure you have all the patches:

## Fix 7: Check your DLC

 Halo Infinite is a big title that comes with multiple DLCs, but some of them might not work so well in the beta. Halo fans have discovered a potential fix to the crash, which is to disable a specific DLC named**Multiplayer High-Res Textures** . Some players reported this pack is causing performance issues, so you can try to toggle it on/off and see how things go.

Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam client and go to **LIBRARY** . Right-click **Halo Infinite** and select **Properties..** .
2. In the left pane, select**DLC** . Uncheck the box before**Multiplayer High-Res Textures** . Then restart your game.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Multiplayer-High-Res-Textures.jpg)

## Fix 8: Scan and repair Windows

 If none of the fixes above work for you, chances are you’re looking at a**system issue** . We all use our computers differently, it’s usually hard to tell what went wrong exactly. So before you reinstall Windows for this $60 game, you can try to scan your system with a professional repair tool.

 And for that job we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a system optimizer that scans and repairs system issues without damaging personal data.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).
