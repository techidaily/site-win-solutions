### Fix 1: Check your PC specs

 To troubleshoot the game crashing issue, the very first step is to check your PC specs. If your PC doesn’t meet the game’s minimum system requirements, you may need to upgrade your PC first.

4. Click**Exit** .

 After confirming that your device is powerful enough to run the game, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Repair your system files

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 If your game files are missing or corrupted, you’re more likely to encounter crashing issues in FNAF Security Breach. To rule out this issue, you can verify the integrity of game files via Steam. Here’s how:

1. Launch**Steam** and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click**Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach** and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/steam-properties.jpg)
3. Click**LOCAL FILES** and select**Verify integrity of game files…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
4. Wait a few minutes for Steam to scan and repair game files.

 Once the process is complete, relaunch the game and check if the crashing issue persists.

If this method gives you no luck, go for the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics cards are essential to video games. To get the best performance out of your hardware, you should keep your graphics driver up to date. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, FNAF Security Breach crashing is more likely to occur.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing it step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install it manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 5: Run the game in DirectX 11 mode

 Some players found that running the game in DirectX 11 mode can fix the crashing issue in Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach. As a temporary workaround, you can give it a shot. Here’s how:

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach** and select**Properties…** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/steam-properties.jpg)
3. Under the**General** tab, add**\-dx11** to the**LAUNCH OPTIONS** . This will force the game to run in DirectX 11 mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/steam-launch-options-dx11.jpg)
4. Close the window.

If the crashing issue persists, continue with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 The applications running in the background could interfere with your game and cause it to crash at startup. To see if that’s the case, you can perform a clean boot. This will restart your PC with only essential services running, allowing you to figure out the potential conflicting software. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

3. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as**Realtek** ,**AMD** ,**NVIDIA** and**Intel** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.

5. One at a time,**select** any programs you suspect might be interfering and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-disable-programs.jpg)

 Restart your PC and launch Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach to check if the game crashes again. If not, open the**System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications one by one until you find the conflicting software. Be sure to restart your PC after enabling each service.
