 Still no luck? Don’t worry, there are a few other fixes you can try.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

To ensure that you get the most out of your graphics card, you need to check for graphics driver updates. This may help you fix the black screen issue immediately.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 4\. Run your game as admin

 Sometimes your game may fail to start as intended because it lacks the administrative rights. To fix it, attempt to run Evil Resident Village as an administrator:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

![run Resident Evil Village as an administrator ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-as-an-administrator-Compatibility.png)

 After applying the changes, launch your game and it should be running with administrative privileges.

## 5\. Disable HDR

 High-Dynamic Range (HDR) refers to the ability of a monitor to display a wider range of contrast ratio and color than an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) display. This means the image on display is closer to real life. Despite its fascinating features, it could be the cause that your game merely shows a black screen according to players. Therefore, you may need to disable HDR and check if it solves your issue. To do this, take these steps:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  
  
![Resident Evil Village disable HDR](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/resident-evil-village-properties-1.png)

 2) Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Then click**Browse…** and you’ll be brought to the game’s installation directory.  
  
![disable HDR Resident Evil Village](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/browse-local-file.png)

 3) Find the**config** file and open it.

 4) Locate**HDRMode** and set the value to**False** .

 After you’ve saved the changes, launch the game and you should be able to enjoy your gameplay.
