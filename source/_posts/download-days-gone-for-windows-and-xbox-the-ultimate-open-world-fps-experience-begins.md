## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Low FPS, lagging gameplay, or poor graphics aren’t always caused by an old graphics card. Sometimes, updating your graphics driver can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game significantly run smoother. Moreover, updating your graphics can ensure that you always have the newest features. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now as it can make a big difference.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by heading to the manufacturer’s driver download page:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

Its detailed query information, graphical interface and ease of use makes this a great tool for finding performance bottlenecks in your MySQL databases. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 As described above, updating drivers manually does require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 5\. Disable fullscreen optimizations

After saving the changes, launch Days Gone and check if it helped.

## 7\. Disable background apps

 You may not know that many apps run in the background at all times – even the ones you never use! They use a portion of your system resources, making your machine run a little bit slower. And this may result in poorer programs performance. To get rid of this, you can attempt to disable background apps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Privacy** .  
  
![turn off background apps](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/privacy.jpg)

 3) Click**Background apps** . Under the section**Let apps run in the background** , toggle the button to turn it**Off** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![turn off background apps](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/turn-off-background-apps.jpg)

Now launch Days Gone and check it can help fix the low frame rate.

## 8\. Disable Windows 10 Game Mode

 Game Mode is a feature introduced to Windows 10 to make gaming a much better experience. But many PC gamers have noticed that with Game Mode enabled, performance issues such as poorer frame rates, stutters and freezes would arise. To prevent these from happening, you can follow the steps below to turn off Game Mode:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Gaming** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gaming-1200x674.jpg)

 3) Select**Game Mode** . Then click the toggle to turn Game Mode**Off** .  
  
![disable Windows 10 game mode](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-game-mode.jpg)
