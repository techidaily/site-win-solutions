##  Find the Number of Days Between Dates With Subtraction

 To know [how many days there are](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-ultimate-guide-to-the-best-10-video-saving-devices/) between two days with the - (minus) sign method, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 We will use the following spreadsheet which has both a start date and an end date:

![An Excel spreadsheet with a start and an end date.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-find-days-spreadsheet.png) 

 It should happen automatically, but make sure the [text for your dates is formatted as date values](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-drfone-by-drfone-android/).

 In your spreadsheet, click the cell in which you want to display the answer. This cell will show the number of days between your specified dates.

![Click the cell in which to display the result.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-select-cell.png) 

 In your selected cell, type the following formula and press Enter. In this formula, replace `C2` with the cell where you have your end date, and replace `B2` with the cell where you have your start date.

=C2-B2

![Enter the formula to find the number of days between two dates.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-enter-days-formula.png) 

 And instantly, you will see the answer in the cell where you typed the formula.

##  Calculate the Days Between Two Dates With the DAYS Function

 Excel's `DAYS` function is dedicated to finding the number of days between two dates. It effectively performs the same calculation that the subtraction method does, so it's up to you which method you use.

 To use this function, open a spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. In the spreadsheet, click the cell in which you want to display the answer.

 In your selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. In this function, replace `C2` with the cell where you have your end date, and replace `B2` with the cell where your start date is.

=DAYS(C2,B2)

![Enter the DAYS function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-enter-days-function.png)

 If you'd like to use the dates directly in the function, you can do so. In this case, in the above function, replace `C2` with the end date and `B2` with the start date. Make sure to add double quotes around each date.

 Like this:

=DAYS("27/7/2021","25/3/2021")

![Enter the DAYS function with direct values.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-enter-days-function-with-direct-values.png)
