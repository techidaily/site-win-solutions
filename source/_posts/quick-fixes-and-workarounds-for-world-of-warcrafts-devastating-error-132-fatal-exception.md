7. Open World of Warcraft and the game will rebuild these folders.

 Try playing the game and see if it works.

### Fix 8: Check for malware and virus

 If your computer is affected by malware or virus, you’re likely to run into the error 132 when playing WOW, or the malware can fake the error message. So you should run a full and complete scan for your system.

 So run a virus scan across your entire Windows system. Yes, it will take some time to complete, but it’s worth it. Unfortunately, Windows Defender may not detect it, so it’s worth trying another antivirus application such as Avira and Panda.

 If any malware has been detected, follow the instructions provided by the antivirus program to fix it.

 Then restart your computer and try to launch your program again to see if it works.

 So that’s it. Hope this post comes in handy and helps resolve the error 132 in World of Warcraft. If you have any questions, feel free to add a comment and we’ll see what more we can do.
