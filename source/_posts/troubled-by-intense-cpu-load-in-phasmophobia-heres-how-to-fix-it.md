## Fix 1: Disable unnecessary background programs

 Programs running in the background can be eating your CPU, so don’t forget to close the ones you don’t need before you start the game. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Under the**Processes** tab, look for the processes that are CPU-hogging. Right-click it then click**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-27_11-34-04.jpg)

If your CPU usage is still high, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Change your PC’s power plan

 By default, your PC’s power plan is set to “Balanced”. It aims at balancing energy consumption and performance, and thus your CPU speed may be limited. If you’re experiencing high CPU usage, try setting the power plan to “High Performance”. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**control panel** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-26_17-53-31.jpg)
3. Choose**View by: Small icons** , then click**Power options** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Set the power plan to**High performance** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Restart your PC to apply the changes.

If this doesn’t fix your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Allow high graphics performance for the game

 To fix high CPU usage while playing Phasmophobia, you can force your graphics to run in high performance mode for the game. In this way, anything that requires GPU in the game will be using GPU, instead of CPU.

 However, this method doesn’t guarantee better performance since every game/program differs, so you may want to try different modes to see which one helps most with your high CPU usage without affecting the game. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**graphics** then select**Graphics settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Click**Browse** and add Phasmophobia.exe to the list. The default installation location should be**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-27_14-05-23.jpg)
3. Once the game executable is added, click**Options** .

## Fix 4: Update your device drivers

 Outdated or faulty drivers could trigger the high CPU usage problem. By updating your device drivers, bugs and compatibility issues can be fixed so you’re less likely to experience high CPU usage while playing Phasmophobia .

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your PC: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can run a scan and update the drivers[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Since Windows may not always give you the latest available updates, you may need to go to the manufacturer’s website, and search for the most recent correct drivers. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your system, then it will download and install them correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-27_14-36-10.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged drivers to automatically download the correct version of the drivers, then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 5: Adjust in-game settings

 Most of us are familiar with or have at least tried to adjust graphics settings in-game for a better performance. But not all settings affect only the GPU, but also your CPU.

 It’s hard to tell what settings exactly you should adjust, since we all have different PC specs and every game varies. But in general, you can try to **lower or disable V-Sync, shadow quality, resolution, and anti-aliasing** . Steam players also suggested**turning off volumetric lighting** helped, so it’s definitely worth a try.

 Tweaking these settings may or may not reduce your CPU usage, but at least you should get a FPS boost. You may have to tinker around to find what works best for you. If this fix doesn’t solve your problem, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 6: Install the latest Windows updates

 High CPU usage may also be a sign that your system needs an update. If your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be compatibility issues and bugs. Make sure that you always install the available updates. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.

3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation if needed.

4. Restart your PC to apply the changes.
