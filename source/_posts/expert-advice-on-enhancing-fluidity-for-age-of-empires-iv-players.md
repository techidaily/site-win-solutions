## Upgrade Your Borderlands N Experience: Get Rid of Those Irritating Lags

Is your Borderlands 3 so laggy that it’s all but unplayable? If yes, don’t lose hope so soon – this post might help you clear up the problem. Many players are experiencing lag issues with Borderlands 3, just like you. Common as it is, lagging can be caused by various reasons, mostly network-related or hardware-related. Now let’s dig right in and see what’s what.

## What sort of “lag” issues I’m having?

 Do you know that “lag issue” typically refers to network-related problems? For example, major lag spikes. This is one of the most common problems among online games, such as LOL, Fortnite, and Apex Legends. Obviously you can play Borderlands 3 either online or offline, so if your issue only occurs in online mode (for example, when you’re playing online multiplayer), then there’s no doubt that you’re having a real lag issue. In this case, take note of your network condition and find some ways to improve it.

 If your Borderlands 3 seems laggy even in offline mode, then you’re very likely having a frame rate problem (e.g., having low FPS because your computer can barely handle the game). There’s also an outside chance that the game per se has some unforeseen bugs, so you could only wait for new patches to fix them.

 Now, after figuring out what sort of “lag” issues you have, read on and find possible fixes for your problem.

## Fixes for Borderlands 3 lag issues

 Here are several fixes that have proved useful to Borderlands 3 players. You don’t need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

**[Fix 6: Get a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Fix 1: Restart your modem and router**

 You should restart your modem and router especially when they haven’t been switched off for a long time. Just give them some time to cool off and clear up the cache. Here’s how to do it:

1) Unplug both your router and modem.

2) Wait at least 30 seconds to let the two machines cool down a bit.

3) Plug the modem back in and wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

4) Plug the router back in. Likewise, wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

5) Now that your routers and modem have been restarted properly, you can launch Borderlands 3 again to see if the lag issue remains. If it does, move on to the next fix.

#### Fix 2:**Renew IP address**

To renew your IP address, you should perform the following procedure:

 1) On your taskbar, type **command** into the search box. Then right-click on the **Command Prompt** result and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-137.png)

 Click **Yes** if you’re prompted about permission.

2) In your command prompt window, enter the following command:

ipconfig /release

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the release is completed.

3) Then type the following command:

ipconfig /renew

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the renewal is completed.

4) This time, enter:

ipconfig /flushdns

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the process is completed.

 Exit the Command Prompt window. Now check to see if your Borderlands 3 is still laggy. If it is, proceed to Fix 3, below.

#### **Fix 3: Change DNS server**

 Try to switch your ISP’s DNS server to the Google Public DNS address. This may improve the resolve time and provide you with more security online. Here are the steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type in **control panel** and press **Enter** .

 6) In the pop-up window, select these two options: **Obtain an IP address automatically** and **Use the following DNS server addresses** .

 For the **Preferred DNS server** , enter **8.8.8.8**  to replace the primary IP address; for the **Alternate DNS server** , enter **8.8.4.4** . Then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-484.png)

 If you want to restore your DNS server addresses, simply change **Use the following DNS server addresses** to **Obtain DNS server address automatically** and then restart your network adapter.

 Check to see if your lag issue still persists. If it does, try out the next fix.

#### **Fix 4: Close bandwidth-hogging applications**

 Having too many applications in the background will slow down your network and trigger lag issues. So, make sure you close all the unnecessary programs before playing Borderlands 3\. Here’s how to check and disable them:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **resmon** and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-613.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399" border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) In the **Resource Monitor** window, on the **Network** tab, take note of the **Total (B/sec)** column. In this way, you’ll get an intuitive view of what process is now taking up the most of your network resources.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-482.png)

 3) **Right-click** on the process that you want to disable and select **End Process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-621.png)

 4) If prompted for permission, click **End process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-508.png)

 Exercise caution with Step 3 and 4.**DO NOT** close any unfamiliar processes in case you mistakenly end some of the crucial ones (often related to your system), such as sychost.exe.

 5) Repeat the steps above until you’ve closed all the bandwidth-hogging programs.

 6) Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If your game works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this fix didn’t work, take a stab at the next one.

#### **Fix 5: Swap Wi-Fi to an Ethernet connection**

 This fix is solely for Wi-Fi users. Since the wireless network is not as stable as the wired one, you’ll get more interruptions if your computer is connected to Wi-Fi. For example, when you’re playing Borderlands 3 in a room far away from your router, the Wi-Fi signal received can be rather weak, hence the reason for a lag issue.

 To solve this problem, you should swap Wi-Fi to an Ethernet connection, but this is not practical for everyone. Alternatively, you may buy a **[powerline Ethernet adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Extollo-Ethernet-Powerline-LANSocket-1500/dp/B00Y3XRRI8/ref=lp%5F1194444%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1564037547&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&tag=drivereasycom-20)**  which extends the reach of your home network to places with poor wireless coverage.

 Also, you should avoid possible wireless interference that weakens your Wi-Fi signal such as cordless phones and microwave ovens. Place them far away from your router, or simply move your laptop somewhere else.

#### **Fix 6: Get a VPN**

 Virtual Private Network (VPN) enables you unlimited access to game servers around the globe. Once you connect to a VPN server (whether it locates within or outside your country), you can choose a region which is less busy to play the game in. On another note, Internet Service Providers (ISP) may sometimes throttle Internet connection speeds to prevent congestion especially when you’re doing something data-intensive, such as playing online video games. But with a VPN, your online activity data are encrypted so ISP won’t find out what you’re doing, hence you’re not likely to be throttled.

 In a word, VPN may help you resolve your lag issue in some cases. So what VPN you should probably choose? Remember, never use a free VPN. Just as the phrase goes, “If You’re Not Paying For It, You Become The Product.” Using free VPNs can have negative consequences sometimes, like information leakage.

 Here I’d strongly suggest you go for **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[ExpressVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You could google them and there should be lots of information about these two VPNs boasting military-level encryption, reasonable price, high network speed, and mostly positive reputation, etc. Above all, both of them are provided by reliable companies.

 Hopefully the 6 fixes above helped you resolve the lag issues with Borderlands 3\. Now it’s time for the next part – how to tackle “lag” issues related to low FPS.

### **I’m having frame rate problems**

 More often than not, frame rate problems are related to your hardware (for example, your PC can hardly keep up with the game). Regarding how to improve your FPS in Borderlands 3, I’ve already written a post before: **[FPS Drops in Borderlands 3? Try These Fixes on PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It includes 8 fixes that helped resolve the frame rate problem and if you’re interested in it, just check it out.

Now I’ll list three of the fixes included:

**[Fix 1: Update your graphics card drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**[Fix 2: Modify in-game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**[Fix 3: Disable fullscreen optimizations](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Fix 1: Update your graphics card drivers**

 Updating graphics drivers is typically a good idea when you encounter lag issues caused by low FPS. You can update your drivers in Windows Device Manager, but sometimes it may fail to detect an out-dated driver, hence unable to provide a newer one; you can also download the graphics drivers from [NVIDIA](https://www.geforce.com/drivers) , [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , etc. and then install them manually.

 However, if you want to update all your device drivers (which is beneficial to your computer by the way), the two methods above may be of limited use. In this case, we highly recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to manage all your driver updates because it significantly saves your time and effort.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of everything** .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-439.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to your graphics card driver to automatically download its correct version, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
