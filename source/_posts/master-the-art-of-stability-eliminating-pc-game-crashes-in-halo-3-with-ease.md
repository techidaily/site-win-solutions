 **Here are the minimum specs to run_World of Tanks Blitz_ :**

| **OS:**        | Windows 7, 8.0, 8.1, 10                         |

| **Memory:**    | 2 GB RAM                                        |
| **Graphics:**  | DirectX 11 compliant video card with 256 MB RAM |

**2)**  Check your **operating system, processor and memory** .

 If your system falls short of the game’s requirements, consider upgrading your hardware or adjusting the game settings to lower graphics options.

### Fix 2: **Run your game as Administrator**

_WoT Blitz_ doesn’t have full access to game files and folders on your computer if you’re running it under normal user mode. Try granting_WoT Blitz_ administrative privileges to see if that’s the problem for you. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Exit Steam completely.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon** and select **Properties** .

* **[If you’re on Windows 7…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**4)** Try launching WoT Blitz again to see if it works properly now.

If your issue continues to occur, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 4:**Update your graphics driver**

_World of Tanks Blitz_ crashing issues are likely to occur when you’re using a faulty graphics driver or it’s outdated. To keep your game running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver at all times. There are 2 ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/world-of-tanks-blitz-keeps-crashing/#c2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating drivers. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-05_12-12-36.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-05_12-12-49.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 5:**Set your PC’s power plan to High performance**

 Your computer might slow down automatically to save energy if you set the power plan to Balanced. Although it’s unlikely that the power plan is the core issue, you should rule out the possibility. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.
