### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is no doubt one of the most important hardware for gaming. So **if your graphics driver is outdated or faulty, you might experience a black screen while playing Rainbow Six Siege** . Besides, the manufacturers of graphics cards frequently release new drivers, which usually can improve the performance of new games. If you don’t remember the last time you updated your graphics driver, then now is a great time to have it done.

Here are two ways you can try to update your graphics driver:

#### Option 1 — Manually

 You can go to the official website ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) of your graphics card to download and install the latest version of the driver. This needs some time, patience and computer skills.

#### **Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct drivers for your exact devices and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scannow-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Or you can click Update next to the flagged device driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rtx660-1.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, launch Rainbow Six Siege and see if the issue persists.

If the black screen issue still remains, you can try the next fix.
