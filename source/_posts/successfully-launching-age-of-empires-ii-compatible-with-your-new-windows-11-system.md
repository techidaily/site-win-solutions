## 1\. Allow Minecraft installer through firewall

 The Windows Firewall is a built-in application that protects users from internet-based threats. However, sometimes it may mistakenly prevent trustworthy software from making changes on your system. To check if that’s your case, you can manually add Minecraft installer to the list of bypassing the firewall. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left menu, select**Privacy & security** . Then click**Windows Security** .

5. Make sure Minecraft is on the list and the**Private** and**Public** options are checked. If it’s not on the list, that means Minecraft doesn’t have access and you’ll need to click on the**Change settings** button.

 After applying the changes, try installing Minecraft and check if it’s working properly. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

 After updating drivers, restart your computer. Upon the reboot, try to install Minecraft to see if you can do it successfully. If it fails, move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Run Windows Store troubleshooter

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Scroll down and find**Troubleshoot** . Make sure you click on it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/microsoft-store-apps-run-troubleshooter.png)

 Then wait for it to detect and troubleshoot your issues. If it fails to identify them, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If all else fails, it’s time you check whether you have missing or corrupted system files, which will negatively affect your system’s performance and even trigger some errors. In this situation, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to run the command sfc /scannow. But most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **Download** and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
