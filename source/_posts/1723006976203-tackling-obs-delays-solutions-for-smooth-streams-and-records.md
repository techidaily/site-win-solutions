## Tackling OBS Delays? Solutions for Smooth Streams and Records

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-16.png)

 It’s a bummer when your OBS Studio lags when you’re streaming or recording videos. The reasons why your OBS lags depend on when you’re experiencing the lag.

* **[OBS lagging when live streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[OBS lagging when recording videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 If you’re experiencing lags when streaming, culprits often boil down to**network latency** . But if it keeps lagging even if you’re recording, or exporting your videos, it’s mainly caused by your**graphics card** .

### 1\. Stop other bandwidth-intensive activities

 Bandwidth hogging applications will slow down your network speed and trigger latency issues. Make sure you shut down all the other resource-hungry programs before streaming with OBS; if it’s your family members or friends who are doing bandwidth-intensive activities, just pick another time to stream or ask them politely to give way to you.

 To close other bandwidth-intensive apps, refer to the following procedure:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **resmon** and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-613.png)

 2) In the **Resource Monitor** window, on the **Network** tab, take note of the **Total (B/sec)** column. In this way, you’ll get an intuitive understanding of what process is now using the most of your bandwidth.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-620.png)

 3) **Right-click** on the application that’s eating up your bandwidth and select **End Process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-621.png)

 4) When Windows asks you to confirm, click **End process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-622.png)

**Note:** Make sure you know what sort of applications you’re closing. **DO NOT** stop any programs that you’re not familiar with in case you mistakenly end the crucial ones (often related to your system) such as sychost.exe.

 If you find no luck getting closer to the solution, you should proceed to Fix 2.

### 2\. Use “flushdns” command

 This command is pretty useful to solve network-related issues. When you’re having major lag spikes in games or just feel that your network connection is unstable/stops working, you should always give this fix a try.

 1) On your taskbar, type **command** into the search box. Then right-click on the **Command Prompt** result and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-137.png)

 Click **Yes** if you’re prompted about permission.

2) In your command prompt window, enter the following command:

ipconfig /release

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the release process is complete.

3) Then type the following command:

ipconfig /renew

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the renewal process is complete.

4) This time, enter:

ipconfig /flushdns

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the process is complete.

 Exit the Command Prompt window. Now check to see if your OBS is still laggy. If it is, move on to Fix 3.

### 3\. Restart modem & router

 You should restart your modem and router especially if they haven’t been switched off for a long time. Just give them some time to cool off and clear up the cache. Here’s how to do it:

1) Unplug both your router and modem.

wireless router

2) Wait at least 30 seconds to let the two machines cool down a bit.

3) Plug the modem back in and wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

4) Plug the router back in this time. Likewise, wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

5) Now that your routers and modem have been restarted properly, you can launch OBS again to see if it’s still laggy.

 In case this fix is to little or no avail, read on and check out the next one.

### 4\. Update network adapter drivers

 Your network latency is sometimes caused by an outdated or corrupt driver. If you’re not sure whether your network card driver is up-to-date, you should check.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, but in most cases, Windows won’t provide you with the latest and even necessary driver. You can also find the correct driver online (say, from the manufacturer’s website), download it and install it step by step. But that’s rather time-consuming and error-prone if you’re not familiar with the procedure to update drivers.

 All in all, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, **you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### 5\. Swap Wifi to Ethernet connection

 If none of the fixes above work out for you, then maybe you should shift your focus to the Wi-Fi signals around (only if you’re a Wi-Fi user). Admittedly, the wireless network is not as stable as a wired network so you’ll get more interruptions for having your computer connected to Wi-Fi. Say, when you’re streaming videos or playing games far away from your router, the Wi-Fi signals you receive can be rather weak and hence the reason for latency.

 To clear up this problem, you should swap Wi-Fi to an Ethernet connection but this is not practical for everyone. Alternatively, you can try using a **[powerline Ethernet adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Powerline-ethernet-Adapter-TL-PA4010KIT/dp/B00AWRUICG/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=1AQS3BNGEZITB&keywords=powerline+ethernet+adapter&qid=1558322595&s=gateway&sprefix=power+line%2Caps%2C338&sr=8-3&tag=drivereasycom-20)**  which extends the reach of your home network to places with poor wireless coverage.

 Also, you should avoid possible wireless interference that weakens your Wi-Fi signals such as cordless phones and microwave ovens. Place them far away from your router, or simply move your laptop to a new location with stronger Wi-Fi signals.

### 3\. Shut down unnecessary programs

 If you have too many GPU-intensive programs running in the background, that will definitely slow down the processing speed of your computer and lead to graphics lag. It’s not hard to shut down unnecessary programs, but have you noticed a Windows 10 feature called “Game Bar” that may render poor performance in OBS? If you haven’t, it’s about time you turned it off.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and then type **game mode** in the search box on your taskbar. In the results pane, click **Game Mode settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-450.png)

### 4\. Lower in-game graphics settings

 To free up some resources on your GPU, you should turn down the graphics settings of any games running in the meantime. (Surely there’s no need to do that if you’re not streaming a game.) Then, wait to see if you’re still experiencing lag issues with OBS.
