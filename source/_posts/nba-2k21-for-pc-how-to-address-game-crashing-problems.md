### Fix 1: Check your PC specs

 Total War: Warhammer 2 is a fantastic game, however, it’s one of the most demanding when it comes to your hardware. The game won’t work well unless your computer can handle it.

 The**MINIMUM** system requirements to run WARHAMMER II are:

| **OS:**        | Windows 7 64Bit                              |                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Processor:** | Intel® Core™ 2 Duo 3.0Ghz                    |                    |
| **Memory:**    | 5 GB RAM                                     |                    |
| **Graphics:**  | NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB \| AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p |
| **Storage:**   | 60 GB available space                        |                    |

 If you’re unfamiliar with your PC’s components, follow the instructions below to check it:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time.

**2)**  Type **dxdiag**  and click **OK** .

**3)**  Check your operating system, processor,**and memory** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_12-00-47.jpg)

**4)**  Click the **Display** tab, and then check your graphics card’s information.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_12-00-51.jpg)

 Make sure your PC meets the minimum specs, then go ahead with the fix below. (If your computer doesn’t meet the minimum specs, the only solution would be upgrading your PC.)

### Fix 2: Restart your computer

 If you’re running multiple programs during gameplay, it’s possible that one of them is conflicting with_Total War_ .

 So you should close unnecessary programs while gaming, especially your overlay applications. To do it, the quickest way is to turn off your computer and turn it back on.

 If the crashing issue still exists after killing unnecessary programs, move on to Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Run your game as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited access to files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how:

**1)**  Exit Steam.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Properties.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_14-40-03.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Compatibility** tab, then check**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_14-41-28.jpg)

**4)**  Restart_Total War: WARHAMMER II_ from Steam.

If your game crashes again, then try the next fix.

### Fix 4: Roll back/Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card or GPU is the most important hardware when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver, you’re likely to run into game issues.

 If you’ve updated the driver recently and the game starts to crash, the new driver may be incompatible with your game. In this case, **[rolling back your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to a previous version should fix your issue.

 If you haven’t performed any updates for a long time, or if rolling back the driver didn’t work for you, try **[updating your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to see if it fixes your issue.

#### Roll back your graphics driver

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-29_10-28-13-1.jpg)

**2)** Type**devmgmt.msc** , then click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-29_11-47-41.jpg)

**3)** Double-click**Display adapters** . Then, right-click**your graphics card** and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-29_11-49-10.jpg)

**4)** Click**Roll Back Driver** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-29_11-53-47.jpg)

 If you can’t click the button, or if rolling back to the previous version didn’t fix your issue, then move on and try updating your graphics driver.

#### Update your graphics driver

 There are two ways you can get the right graphics driver: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_12-02-25.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_12-02-36.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**
