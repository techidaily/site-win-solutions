![Farming Simulator 22](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Farming-Simulator-22-FPS-drops-on-PC-fix.png)

A screenshot of Farming Simulator 22 from Steam

 Giants Software launched the latest Farming simulator this week, blowing up the Steam charts. However, as tons of virtual farmers rushed in to plant crops, raise livestock, and manage their businesses, more and more players are reporting that Farming Simulator 22 FPS drops on their PCs. If you find yourself in the same boat, don’t worry. You’ve landed on the right page. After reading this article, you should be able to fix this issue easily!

## Try these fixes

 Here’s a list of fixes that have resolved the Farming Simulator 22 FPS drops for other PC players. You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way through the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Install the latest game patch](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Set the Power Plan of your PC for high performance](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

6. **[Disable overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Install the latest game patch

 Giants Software, the developers of Farming Simulator 22 releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Farming Simulator 22 to see if the FPS is back to normal. If the in-game FPS still drops, or there are no new game patches available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, because the outdated or faulty graphics driver may trigger the Farming Simulator 22 FPS dropping issue.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Set the Power Plan of your PC for high performance

 A power plan is a set of system and hardware settings on Windows OS. It’s designed to manage how your computer consumes and conserves power. Generally speaking, the higher the performance, the more power your computer consumes.

 In most cases, the power plan on PCs is configured to Balanced by default, which may limit the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. In Windows 10 or Windows 11, you can customize the power plan on your PC, which allows you to gain more performance.

 If you’re experiencing performance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .  
![control panel power options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)

 Launch Farming Simulator 22 and check if you get a better PFS. If the Farming Simulator 22 FPS drops again, try the next fix, below.

## Optimize in-game graphics settings

 Optimizing the graphics settings is another fix that may boost the in-game FPS, especially if your PC barely meets the minimum system requirements of Farming Simulator 22\. If you have a powerful PC, just skip this fix.

 Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower the following in-game graphics settings:

 Launch the game and go to**Options** \>**Display Settings** first:

* Set**V-Sync** to**Off**
* Reduce the Resolution Scaling to 80% if your PC barely meets the minimum system requirement for FS 22.

 Then press**the Spacebar** to access**Advanced Graphics Settings** . Then change the graphics settings as follows:

* **Multisampling Anti-Aliasing:** Off
* **Post Process Anti-Aliasing:** Off
* **DLSS:** Performance or Balanced if your graphics card supports DLSS. If not, then turn DLSS off.
* **FidelityFx Super Resolution** : Off
* **Shadow Quality** : Off; set it to Medium if you have a powerful PC.
* **Shadow Distance Quality** : Low
* **SSAO Quality** : Low; set it to Medium if you have a powerful PC.
* **Light Quality** : Low; set it to Medium if you have a powerful PC.
* **Object Draw Distance** : 50 – 70
* **Terrain LOD Distance** : 50 – 70
* **Resolution Scaling 3D** : 50 – 100
* **Max Mirrors** : 0
* **Texture Filtering** : Bilinear
* **Shadow Map Filtering** : Low
* **Terrain Quality** : Low; set it to High if you have a powerful PC.
* **Foliage Draw Distance** : 50 – 70
* **Foliage Shadows** : Off
* **Mesh Tessellation Volume** : 50 – 100
* **Realistic Beacon Lights** : Off
* **Texture Resolution** : Low
* **Max Shadow Lights** : 1
* **Shader Quality** : Low
* **LOD Distance** : 50 – 80
* **Cloud Quality** : Low
* **Max Tire Tracks** : 0 – 50
* **Shading Rate** : Low

 Re-launch Farming Simulator 22 after you modify the in-game graphics settings to check if its FPS still drops, try the next fix, below.

## Modify graphics card settings

 Tweaking your graphics card settings in Nvidia or AMD control panel may also improve the in-game FPS. If you didn’t modify your graphics card settings, then you should give it a try.

**For Nvidia users** , follow the steps below:

1. **Right-click** on your desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** from the context menu.
2. Click **Manage 3D Settings** on the left, then navigate to the **Program Settings** tab. In the **Select a program to customize:**  part, add **Farming Simulator 22** from the program list.
3. In the **Specify the settings for this program** section, modify the following settings:  
**Max Frame Rate** : Set it to a frame rate below your monitor’s current refresh rate.  
**OpenGL rendering GPU** : Set it to your Nvidia GPU  
**Power Management** : **Prefer Maximum Performance**  
**Low Latency Mode** : **Ultra**  
**Vertical sync** : **Fast**  
**Texture filtering – Quality** : **Performance**
4. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

**For AMD users** , follow the steps below:

1. Open **AMD Radeon Settings** .
2. Go to **Gaming** **\>** **Global Settings** . Then modify the settings the same way you see on the screenshot below.  
![AMD Radeon Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AMD-Radeon-Settings.jpg)

 Launch Farming Simulator 22 and see if the in-game FPS increases. If not, move on to the next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 According to many PC gamers, overlays sometimes may interfere with FS 22 and even introduce performance issues and compatibility issues. If the fixes above you tried didn’t give you an obvious FPS boost, then you can try disabling the in-game overlay before playing the game.

 Many apps provide overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right-click on the Farming Simulator 22 game title and click **Properties…** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. In the **GENERAL** section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features, such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay feature in those apps before you restart the game.

 Launch Farming Simulator 22 again after you disable all the in-game overlays and see if the in-game FPS improves. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar (Windows 10)

 The background recording and Xbox Game Bar feature in Windows 10 is convenient for those who love sharing game highlight videos. However, once enabled, they’ll constantly run in the background, hogging tons of resources.

 If you’ve enabled background recording and Xbox Game Bar, and you’re suffering from in-game FPS drops, try disabling them. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open **Windows Settings** . Click **Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.  
![Windows 10 settings gaming](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-10-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under **Xbox Game Bar** if it is turned on.  
![Turn off Xbox Game Bar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Xbox-Game-Bar.jpg)
3. Click **Captures** on the left, then **turn off** the toggle udner **Background recording** if it is turned on.
