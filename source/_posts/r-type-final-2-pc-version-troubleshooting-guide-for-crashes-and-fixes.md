### 3\. Verify the game integrity

 Another possible cause of ‘**Unreal process has crashed: UE4-Madness error** ‘ in Outriders is corrupted or missing game files. To check if this is causing the Unreal Engine to crash, you can try this simple troubleshooting:

 1) Launch Steam, and go to the**Library** tab

 2) Right-click **OUTRIDERS Demo** and select **Properties** .

 3) Go to the LOCAL FILES tab, and click**Verify Integrity of game files** .

 4) Wait for the process to complete. It may take a few seconds to verify the integrity of your game files.

 Once complete, you can restart the game to check if the Unreal Engine error has been solved by now.

### 4\. Force Outriders to run in DX11

 When you click the Play button, and you’ll be prompted to choose DirectX 12 or DirectX 11\. You can try playing the game in DX11 this way or you can force Outriders to run in DX11 so that you don’t need to do this every time:

 1) Right-click **OUTRIDERS Demo** and select **Properties** .

 2) In the**GENERAL** tab, copy and paste**\-force -dx11** in the**LAUNCH OPTIONS** box.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-in-dx-11.jpg)

 Now when you click the Play button, the game is always run in DX11\. If this method doesn’t do the trick, you can change the launch option back to**\-force -dx12** .

### 5\. Launch the game in your game folder

 This method has helped many players solve the Unreal Game crashes. If you don’t know the exact installation location of your game, here’s how to do it:

 1) Go to your game folder (it depends, for me is**D:\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\OUTRIDERS Demo** ). Or you can browse the game folder in Steam.

 2) Right-click**OUTRIDERS-Win64-Shipping** and select**Properties** .

 3) Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check**Run this program as an administrator** .

 4) Launch the game from the exe.

 Granting enough access and running the game directly worked for many other players. If Outriders is still crashing with ‘Unreal process has crashed: UE4-Madness error’, you can try the fix below.

### 6\. Allow your game to run through Firewall

 If the issue persists, you can check if it’s caused by an over-protective Firewall or your Antivirus software (you can temporarily uninstall your antivirus software). To make sure the Windows Defender Firewall is not blocking your game, here’s how:

1) On your keyboard, press the Windows + R key at the same time.

2) Type**firewall.cpl** in the box, and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/firewall.jpg)

 3) On the left pane, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/allow-firewall.jpg)

 4) Now you can click**Change settings** and scroll down to Outriders to make sure the**Private** and**Public** boxes are both checked.

 5) If Outriders is not on the list, you can select**Allow another app..** . and then add your Outriders.

 Now you can launch your game again to check the ‘Unreal process has crashed: UE4-Madness error’ is gone.
