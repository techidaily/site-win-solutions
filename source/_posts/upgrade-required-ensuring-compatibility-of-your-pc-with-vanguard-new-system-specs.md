 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

 See if HLL crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix failed to resolve this issue, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of the HLL crashing issue is program conflicts. If there is a certain program conflicting with HLL, it will lead to the crashing issues. In this case, you need to perform a clean boot to find out the problematic program that crashes the game. Here's how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
