![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-74.png)

 If**Metro Exodus crashes** on your computer, don’t worry. There are solutions to fix Metro Exodus crashing issues. Follow the instructions below.

## How to fix Metro Exodus crashing

 Here are the fixes for Metro Exodus crashing. You shouldn’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working again.

1. **[Install the latest patch](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Stop overclocking your CPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Switch to DX11 in your game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Lower the in-game video settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

---

### Fix 1: Install the latest patch

 Outdated versions of the software may bring buggy issues when you’re using the software, and Metro Exodus is no exception. That’s why the software developers keep releasing new patches to fix bugs and improve features.

 So check for updates for Metro Exodus and install any available updates. Then restart your computer and see if the game stops crashing or not.

---

### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your CPU

 Overclocking means setting your CPU and memory to run at speeds higher than their official speed rate, and almost all processors ship with a speed rating. However, this may cause your game to crash or freeze. In that case, you should set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to fix your issue.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If the device drivers in your computer are missing or outdated, especially your graphics card driver, you may have the game crashing issue. To rule it out as the cause for Metro Exodus crashing, try updating your video driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-metro-exodus-crashing-on-pc/#a2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Your device manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website of your graphics card, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**_Update All_** ).

### Fix 4: Switch to DX11 in your game settings

 This method works like a charm for many players who have the same crashing issue in Metro Exodus, so it’s worth a try when you’re using DirectX 12 for Metro Exodus.

 If you’re using DirectX 12, you can downgrade to DirectX 11 to play the game by following the steps below. but if you’re using DirectX 10 or DirectX 9 and you’re having this problem, you may need to go to the Microsoft website to download DirectX 11 into your computer.

#### **If you can run the game up:**

 1) Go to Metro Exodus >**Options** .

 2) Go to**Video** \>**DirectX** .

 3) Choose**DirectX 11** , then save your changes.

### Fix 5: Lower the in-game video settings

 If the graphics options are too much for your PC, your game will no doubt keep crashing because your PC hardware couldn’t support the graphics requirements configured in the game. So you should set the graphic settings in your game to Low in order to fix the crashing issue.

 For example, be sure to set the resolution to the monitor resolution that your computer has, and set Low for these settings: Quality, Motion Blur, and Ray Tracing. Turn off VSync or Hairworks, or both.
