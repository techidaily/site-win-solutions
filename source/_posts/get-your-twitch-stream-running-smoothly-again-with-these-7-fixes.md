## 2\. Run the game with administrator rights

 Some games run into stability issues or crashes if they do not have administrator access to modify certain protected files, registry keys, or hardware functions. Running Avatar as an admin could resolve these permission-related clashes.

 To let your game**temporarily** have administrator rights, right-click on its desktop icon or the .exe file in its install folder and choose**Run as administrator** from the menu.

To make your game permanently run with admin rights for all users:

1. Right-click its desktop icon or the executable file in the installation folder, and select**Properties** .
2. Click on the**Compatibility** tab, then click**Change settings for all users** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-Change-settings-for-all-users.jpg)
3. Check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-Run-this-program-as-an-administrator-1.jpg)

 After applying the changes, launch the game. If your issue persists, don’t worry! Below are some other fixes for you to try.

## 3\. Disable background applications

 Other applications running in the background on your PC while trying to play Avatar could potentially interfere with stability or system resources. End unnecessary background processes before launching the game.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **taskmgr**  and hit Ener to open the Task Manager.

If your game still crashes, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Update Windows

 Keeping Windows updated with the latest patches and fixes can significantly improve gaming performance and prevent crashes related to OS bugs or conflicts.

 Note: The screenshots below have been mostly taken from a Windows 10 operating system. If you are using Windows 11, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** , then type **check for updates** . Open the settings **Check for updates**  from the list of results.

## 5\. Update your graphics card driver

 One of the most common culprits behind game crashes and instability is outdated or faulty graphics card drivers. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel regularly issue optimized driver updates for games to run best on their GPUs.

 Visit the website for your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest driver package:

* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/support)
* [Intel](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/support/products/80939/graphics.html)
* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 If you don’t have to time or patience to update drivers manually, you can do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . If your PC is having persistent display issues, we recommend you use a third-party driver updater like Driver Easy. A professional tool not only updates drivers on your PC, it also fixes those that are either broken or missing altogether.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

2. Go to the**Games** tab and choose your game.
3. Select**Properties** in the menu. Under**Local files** , click**Verify files** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

When the process is completed, launch your game and see how things go.

## 7\. Disable in-game overlay (Ubisoft Connect)

 The overlay feature often requires additional processing power and memory, and disabling it may reduce the overall burden on your system during gameplay.

1. On Ubisoft Connect PC, open the side menu by selecting the**three-lined icon** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Avatar-Frontiers-of-Pandora-Disable-in-game-overlay-three-lines.jpg)
2. Select **Settings** .
3. In the**General** section,**uncheck** the box next to Enable in-game overlay for supported games.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Try to relaunch your game to see if it takes effect.

## 8\. Try -dx11/-dx12 in launch arguments (Ubisoft Connect)

 Certain games may have compatibility issues or encounter errors related to specific DirectX versions. By forcing the game to use either DirectX 11 (“-dx11”) or DirectX 12 (“-dx12”) through launch arguments, you are providing a directive for the game to utilize a particular graphics API.

1. Open Ubisoft Connect PC.
2. Go to the**Games** tab and choose your game.
3. Select**Properties** in the menu. Under**Game launch arguments** , enter**\-dx12** or**\-dx11** into the box and click**Save** .

## 9\. Start your game in High Priority

 Make Windows dedicate more resources to Avatar by setting the game process priority higher in Task Manager:

 Note: The screenshots below have been mostly taken from a Windows 10 operating system. If you are using Windows 11, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit Enter.  
![how to open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-taskmgr.jpg)
3. In the**Processes** tab, right-click your game and select**Go to details** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Avatar-Frontiers-of-Pandora-Go-to-details.jpg)
4. Now the executable will be highlighted, right-click it and select**Set priority > High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Avatar-Frontiers-of-Pandora-Set-priority-High-1.jpg)

 After applying the changes, launch Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. If your game still crashes frequently, try the next fix below.

## 10\. Check for corrupted system files

 Over time, critical Windows system files can become corrupted or damaged from normal PC use, software installations, updates, malware, bad shutdowns, and more. Corrupted files like DLLs, drivers, and registry keys can cause instability, crashes, and error messages.

 To figure out whether it’s a root cause for your game issue, you may want to run a quick and thorough system scan with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Fortect is a comprehensive diagnostic tool that scans your entire computer and identifies hardware risks and system stability issues.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Launch Fortect and run a complete scan.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fortect-START-SCAN.png)
3. You’ll get a scan summary listing all the issues it detects. Click **Start Repair** to fix the problems (and you’ll need to pay for the full version which comes with a **60-day money-back** guarantee).
