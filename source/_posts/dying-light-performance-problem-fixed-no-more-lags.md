## Fix 1: Repair Corrupt System Files

 Missing or corrupt system files can crash your game. If you get error messages indicating that the game is crashing due to certain DLL files, repairing the files might be exactly what you need.

 You can repair corrupt or missing DLL files with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a Windows repair software that can automatically identify and fix issues with your Windows system.

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fotect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. Fortect will scan your device and check for hardware-related issues, security issues, incompatible third-party apps, and missing system files. This might take a few minutes, so please wait patiently.

 3) You’ll see a summary of detected issues on your PC.

 Click **START REPAIR** to fix the issues automatically. This requires the Pro version which comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee. You can refund at anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem.

4) Relaunch your computer and the game to see if the problem is resolved.

If the problem persists, read on and try the fix below.

## Fix 2: Verify the Integrity of Game Files

 You won’t be able to run the game correctly if any critical game files are damaged or missing. To see if this is the core issue, you can verify the integrity of game files from Steam:

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click MIR4 and select **Properties** .

 3) Under the **LOCAL FILES** tab, click **Verify integrity of game files** . (This process may take several minutes. Steam will fix corrupted files automatically if it detects any.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Update Your Graphics Driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing problem is a missing or outdated graphics driver. Try updating your driver to see if it fixes the issue.

There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

## Fix 4: Run as an Administrator

 Follow the instructions below to see how to run the game as an administrator:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Disable Third-Party Programs

 Third-party software running in your computer background sometimes can interfere with MIR4, causing issues like this. So you should turn off inessential software during gameplay, such as your antivirus, NVidia GeForce experience overlay, Discord, etc.

 If this doesn’t do the trick for you, read on and try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Reinstall the game

 If none of the fixes above worked for you, it’s very likely that the game is not properly installed on your PC, and reinstalling it is the solution for you. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .

**2)**  Right-click **MIR4** and select **Manage > Uninstall.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-22_14-49-08.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-22_14-55-41.png)

**4)**  Relaunch Steam to download and reinstall the game.

If the game still won’t run correctly, try the next fix.

## Fix 7: Check for Windows Updates

 If the game won’t run at all, it’s unlikely that the out-of-date Windows version is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-575-7.png)

 3) Restart your computer after the update is complete, then try running MIR4 again.

If the issue persists, try the fix, below.

## Fix 8: Wait for Patch Notes

 If none of the fixes worked for you, chances are the problem is at MIR4’s end. The developers of MIR4 release regular game patches to resolve bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from launching correctly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 Wait for the patch note to be released or you can also contact the MIR4 support team for assistance.
