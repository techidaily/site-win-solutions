## Fix 1: Repair Corrupt System Files

 Missing or corrupt system files can crash your game. If you get error messages indicating that the game is crashing due to certain DLL files, repairing the files might be exactly what you need.

 You can repair corrupt or missing DLL files with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a Windows repair software that can automatically identify and fix issues with your Windows system.

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fotect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. Fortect will scan your device and check for hardware-related issues, security issues, incompatible third-party apps, and missing system files. This might take a few minutes, so please wait patiently.

 3) You’ll see a summary of detected issues on your PC.

 Click **START REPAIR** to fix the issues automatically. This requires the Pro version which comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee. You can refund at anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem.

4) Relaunch your computer and the game to see if the problem is resolved.

If the problem persists, read on and try the fix below.

## Fix 2: Verify the Integrity of Game Files

 You won’t be able to run the game correctly if any critical game files are damaged or missing. To see if this is the core issue, you can verify the integrity of game files from Steam:

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click MIR4 and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-22_12-03-17.png)

 3) Under the **LOCAL FILES** tab, click **Verify integrity of game files** . (This process may take several minutes. Steam will fix corrupted files automatically if it detects any.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-22_12-03-52.png)

4) Restart the game after the process is complete.

If the game still crashes, move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Update Your Graphics Driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing problem is a missing or outdated graphics driver. Try updating your driver to see if it fixes the issue.

There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)**  Restart your PC and MIR4 after the update is complete.

If the issue persists, then go ahead with the fix below.

## Fix 4: Run as an Administrator

 If you’re running the game under normal user mode, it may not be able to access critical game files on your PC – which might cause crashes during gameplay.

 Follow the instructions below to see how to run the game as an administrator:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-342.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-342.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)** Relaunch the game from Steam to test your issue.

If the issue still occurs, go ahead with the next fix.

## Fix 5: Disable Third-Party Programs

 Third-party software running in your computer background sometimes can interfere with MIR4, causing issues like this. So you should turn off inessential software during gameplay, such as your antivirus, NVidia GeForce experience overlay, Discord, etc.

 If this doesn’t do the trick for you, read on and try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Reinstall the game

**1)** Run Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .

**2)**  Right-click **MIR4** and select **Manage > Uninstall.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-22_14-49-08.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 7: Check for Windows Updates

 If the game won’t run at all, it’s unlikely that the out-of-date Windows version is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-575-7.png)

**2)**  Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-576-6.png)

 3) Restart your computer after the update is complete, then try running MIR4 again.

If the issue persists, try the fix, below.

## Fix 8: Wait for Patch Notes

 If none of the fixes worked for you, chances are the problem is at MIR4’s end. The developers of MIR4 release regular game patches to resolve bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from launching correctly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 Wait for the patch note to be released or you can also contact the MIR4 support team for assistance.
