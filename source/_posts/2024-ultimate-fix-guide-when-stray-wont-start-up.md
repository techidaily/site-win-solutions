### Fix 1: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 introduces two types of updates, one tackles security issues and the other offers new features on a regular basis. If the last time you check for system updates feels like a long time ago, definitely do it now as it might fix your crashing issue.

Here’s how to install all system updates:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. This will open the Windows Settings app. Select**Update & Security** .

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of this error is**corrupted or outdated graphics drivers** . So you should definitely try updating your drivers before trying anything more complicated. GPU manufacturers keep releasing new drivers all the time, improving performance and compatibility with new titles. That’s exactly why we recommend to always use the latest driver.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To manually update your graphics driver, you can first visit your GPU manufacturer’s website:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your exact graphics model. Be sure to download the latest correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system. And don’t forget to do a reboot afterwards.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 4: Disable in-game overlays

 While in-game overlays make it convenient to share, communicate and purchase, it might also be the culprit of your crashing issue with Spellbreak. If you’re using in-game overlays such as**GeForce Experience** ,**Discord** or**Radeon™ Overlay** , try disabling them and check if it fixes your problem.

 If Spellbreak crashes when you’re not using any overlays, simply try the next solution below.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 Some players reported that they managed to fix the crash with Spellbreak by closing the overclocking software. Indeed, overclocking offers a free-of-charge performance boost, but at the cost of system stability. So if you’re using BIOS settings or overclocking software such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU)** , there’re great chances that your game will crash constantly. You can therefore try to**stop overclocking** and see if it fixes the crash.

If this method doesn’t work out for you, simply try the next one.
