## Fix 1: Make sure your PC specs meets the requirement

 An online PVP fighter game like Guilty Gear -Strive- could be demanding, so you want to make sure your PC specs are sufficient for it. Below is the**minimum requirement** for this title:

| **OS**         | Windows 8/10 (64-bit)                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | AMD FX-4350, 4.2 GHz / Intel Core i5-3450, 3.10 GHz |
| **Memory**     | 4 GB RAM                                            |
| **Graphics**   | Radeon HD 6870, 1 GB / GeForce GTX 650 Ti, 1 GB     |
| **Storage**    | 20 GB available space                               |
| **DirectX**    | Version 11                                          |
| **Network**    | Broadband Internet connection                       |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible soundcard or onboard chipset     |

 If you want a smoother gaming experience, check out the**recommended specifications** below:

| **OS**         | Windows 8/10 (64-bit)                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel Core i7-3770, 3.40 GHz                    |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB RAM                                        |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce GTX 660                                 |
| **Storage**    | 20 GB available space                           |
| **DirectX**    | Version 11                                      |
| **Network**    | Broadband Internet connection                   |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible soundcard or onboard chipset |

 If your PC specs are sufficient for this game but there are still lag issues, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Check your Internet connection

 Lagging is a network issue, so you need to make sure your Internet connection is reliable and has a high speed. Here’s a few things you can look at:

* When you use Wi-fi to play the game, you don’t want overcrowding to cause poor connectivity and lag issues.   **If your Wi-Fi is connected to multiple devices, try disconnecting the unused ones.**
* Also, consider**playing on** **a wired connection** . It’s usually more reliable and faster.
* **Check your Internet speed** . If you have low-speed Internet, it’s likely to cause lagging issues for Guilty Gear -Strive-. You can google “Internet speed test” and pick a tool to test your Internet speed. If your Internet connection is unreasonably low, you should contact your Internet provider for help.
* You can also try to **power cycle your router and modem** . Unplug the power cables from both of the devices, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then replug the cables back. When your Internet is working again, check if your game still lags.

 If your Internet connection doesn’t seem to cause the lagging, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Refrain from using 4K resolution

 You didn’t hear me wrong. One thing you can do to fix the lagging issue for Guilty Gear -Strive is**not to use 4K resolution** .

 Just prior to the official release, the developers made a post about known significant slowdowns noticed in battle on 4K resolution. Although the game does support 4K resolution, it’s better to lower graphics quality for smoother performance at this moment. We’ll keep an eye on this and post updates when the official fix is released.

 For now, using lower graphics quality can be a temporary workaround. Here’s how to lower resolution in-game:

1. Launch the game. Click**SETTINGS** on the homepage.
2. In the pop-up window, select**Display Settings** .
3. You can adjust the**Resolution** here as needed.

If this doesn’t help solve the lag issues, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Update your network adapter driver

 If your network adapter driver is outdated or faulty, it could affect your Internet connection and therefore cause lags in-game. You may want to update your network adapter driver to make sure it’s functioning properly.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update the network adapter driver[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Note that Windows doesn’t update its database very frequently. That said, it’s possible that your network adapter driver can be updated but Device Manager can’t do it for you if it doesn’t detect a new version in the Windows database.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged network adapter driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. I’m using a graphics driver as an example here, since updating your graphics driver could help with many game issues (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new drivers to take effect. If updating your network adapter driver doesn’t solve the lag issues, try the last fix.

## Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Windows Update releases new patches every now and then, and it’s important to install them when available. By keeping your system up-to-date, you could avoid compatibility issues with the game that may cause any lags. Here’s how to check for Windows updates and install them if available:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)  
 If there are available updates, click**Install updates** .
3. Restart your PC to let it take effect.
