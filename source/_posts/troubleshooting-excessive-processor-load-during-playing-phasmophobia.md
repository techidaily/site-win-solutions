### Fix 2: **Disable gaming overlay**

 Game bar is a gaming overlay built into Windows that allows you to take sceenshots and record your gameplay in the background. Sometimes this feature may be in conflict with Gears 5 and cause it to crash. You can try disabling Game bar to see if this is the case.

Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **game bar settings** . Then click **Game bar settings** as it shows up as a search result.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-132.png)

 2) In **Game bar** , toggle **off** the switch for **Record game clips, screenshots,broadcast using Game bar** .

5) Exit the window.

6) Run Gears of War 5 to see if the crashing issue still happens. If no, then you’ve solved the issue! If yes – the crashing issue still occurs, please move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3:   **Reset the Microsoft Store cache**

### Fix 5: Update DirectX

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards. If you’re running an old version of DirectX, it’s possible that it won’t be able to handle the graphics rendering and processing task, which might cause the Gears of War to crash. So you should update DirectX to the latest version to see if it fixes the issue.

 If you’re not sure which version of DirectX your computer is running, or how to update DirectX, please refer to this **[quick guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Once you’ve updated DirectX, check to see if the game crashes issue is fixed.

 Still not resolved? Please try **Fix 6** , below.

---

### Fix 6: Reinstall the game

 If the above steps didn’t , then it’s time to reinstall the game to see if it works. To do so, simply uninstall the game from your PC, then head to Microsoft Store, search the game, download and install it.

 Once you’ve reinstalled Gears of War 5 on your PC, run it to see if it still crashes.

---

### Fix 7: Disable your X-Fi sound card (If you have an X-Fi sound card)

 According to game forums, many players reported that disabling their X-Fi sound card helped them fix the problem. So if you are also having an X-Fi sound card, you should also give it a try to see if it does the trick.
