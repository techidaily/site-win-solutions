### Fix 3: Add Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application

 If you’re using a third-party antivirus application on your PC, you may encounter the**Discord overlay** not working issue. Your third-party antivirus application may interfere with**Discord** , so your **Discord overlay** may not run as expected. You can try   **adding your Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

### Fix 4: Check for software interruption

 Maybe the**Discord overlay** not working issue is also triggered by the interruption from other applications running on your PC. Try**temporarily disabling them** to see if your**Discord overlay** works or not. If you’re running**the programs that have the overlay features** , or you’re running**the programs that can access your microphone** , they may interfere with your**Discord overlay** .

**Programs like screen recorders**  are most likely to interfere with your **Discord overlay** .

### Fix 5: Disable hardware acceleration in Discord

 It’s very frustrating to run into the voice connection issue when playing the game. But don’t worry, most voice connection errors can be fixed by configuring a VPN connection.

 NordVPN helps you set up a fast, stable, and secure Internet connection anywhere. And it helps you do this with just a few clicks or taps! What’s more, with one NordVPN account, you can set up a VPN connection on all devices. NordVPN allows you to connect up to 6 devices at the same time!
