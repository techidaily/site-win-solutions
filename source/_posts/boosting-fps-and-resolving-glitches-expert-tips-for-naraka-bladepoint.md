 Now launch Naraka: Bladepoint and you should get a better performance. However, if turning on Game Mode didn’t do the trick, don’t worry. Below are some other methods that you can try.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 As described above, manually updating your graphics driver would require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re having performance issues, verifying game files may work like magic. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files are intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or replace any corrupted files. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
