### Fix 4: Repair system files

 Windows taskbar issues could be related to the Windows system files. When Windows system files are missing or outdated, it may trigger bugs like the taskbar not working or disappearing from the desktop.

 Therefore, you need a tool to check the system files and repair the corrupted files automatically. If you’re familiar with command codes, you can run**System File Checker** to check the system files. But it takes time and you have to enter the correct command.

 Or, you can turn to a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your PC and fix them automatically. We recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , as it’s tailored to the Windows system and works in a private way.
