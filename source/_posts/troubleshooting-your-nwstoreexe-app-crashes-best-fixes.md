It’s annoying when you can’t connect to the EA server or receive the error message saying**Connection to server timed out** . Is Apex Legends down again? Or it’s something wrong with your PC? Don’t worry, you’re not the only one, the methods below would help you fix the connection issue.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. [Change DNS to Google](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Run as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Clear game cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Check the server status

 The best way to check the server status is through the official channels. The[Apex Legends Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlayApex) account and the[EA Help](https://twitter.com/EAHelp?lang=en) account offer support for Apex Legends. Also, there’re third-party sites that keeping updating server status.

 If the servers are showing as down, it could be for maintenance or other issues on their end.  
**Tips** : Steam server maintenance happens every Tuesday around 7:30 EST.

 When it’s a server issue, the solution is apparently just to wait. There’s nothing you can do, avoid server maintenance time and play the game another time would be the solution.

**For Steam users** , if you still have this problem outside Steam’s maintenance period, try to eject all USB devices in the system and restart the game.  
 If you don’t have USB devices on but still have this issue, try to insert one such as a flash driver, then eject it and restart the game.

 If you’re a**Origin user** , use the Origin Launcher, it would help.

If it’s not the server, please move to the next method.

### Method 4: Update your drivers

 Check your PC network adapter driver is also important. This driver would affect your internet connection when it’s outdated or broken. Updating the driver would simply fix this issue and improve your PC performance.

 You can manually update these drivers by going to the manufacturer’s official websites, but there’s an easier way — use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your drivers.

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter/ graphic card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
