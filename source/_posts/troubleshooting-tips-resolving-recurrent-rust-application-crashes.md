 2) Some antivirus software will continue working after being disabled. You can add your game to its exception list or temporarily uninstall it.

### Fix 3\. Verify your game files

1) Open the game launcher.

2) Under your profile name, click the down arrow key and then select**Integrity check** .

4) Once complete, go back to the game installation folder again. Open the**BattleEye** folder, and double-click the**Install\_BattleEye.bat** .

5) Now launch your game and check if the issue has been resolved.

### Fix 6\. Update all your device drivers

 When it’s quite hard to troubleshoot the exact cause, we would recommend keeping all your device drivers up to date, including your graphics drivers and network adapter drivers. This would also keep your game from bumping into possible crashes in the future.

 There are mainly two methods for you to update the device drivers (here we take graphics driver for an example):

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged network adapter driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698" border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3080.jpg)

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click _Update All_ .)

 4) Once the driver is updated, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.

### Fix 7\. Reboot your router/modem

 The ‘**Anticheat server connection lost** ‘ can also be caused by network issues. First, you need to make sure you’ve selected the server with the lowest ping. If this doesn’t work, you’d better restart your router.

 Just power off your router for some time and start it normally. Now you can log in again and try playing it again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8\. Use a VPN

 If you have tried all these workarounds above and still you get the ‘Anticheat connection failed’ error in Escape from Tarkov, the best (temporary) solution is to use a VPN with a reasonable ping.

 Using VPN, in general, is terrible for your ping, so it’s important to choose one that really works well with your game. Here we recommend[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ([check the 80% off coupon](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), which also offers a 30-day free trial. You can use the VPN as a temporary fix and wait for the developers to work on a real fix.
