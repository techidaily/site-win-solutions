### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Some applications can interfere with your Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, especially your antivirus software. To check if this is the cause of ‘Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous not launching’, you can temporarily uninstall your antivirus software because simply disabling it might not work.
