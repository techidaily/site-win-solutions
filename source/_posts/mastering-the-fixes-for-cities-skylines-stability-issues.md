## 2\. Make sure your computer is not running hot

 If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Cities: Skylines 2 doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Cities: Skylines 2 crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help Cities: Skylines 2 to stop crashing, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
