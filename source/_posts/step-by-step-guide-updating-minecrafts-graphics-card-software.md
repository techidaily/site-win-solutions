### Fix 1: Check your cable connection

 First you need to**be sure that you have the right display port** . If you‚Äôre using the wrong port, say you have your monitor hooked up with the integrated graphics, your GPU might not show up in Afterburner since you‚Äôre not using it for display.

You should also rule out the possibility of faulty cables.

### Fix 2: Change properties of MSI Afterburner

### Fix 3: Check if you have Vanguard

 If you‚Äôre into Valorant, you might be familiar with**Vanguard** , the anti-cheat program. Records show that Vanguard is a big time trouble maker that is responsible for many game issues. And many players reported that it has something to do with Afterburner not detecting GPU. So if you have Vanguard on your system, you can try to disable/uninstall it and see if Afterburner works properly.

If you don‚Äôt have Vanguard, simply move on to the next fix.

6. Restart your PC.

 If Afterburner works after the clean boot, you can root out the offenders by repeating the steps and disabling only half of the services and programs.

If the issue persists, you can try the next solution below.

### Fix 7: Try another version of Afterburner

 If none of the fixes can help you, you can try to reinstall MSI Afterburner. This should reset profiles and fix possible issues during installation. Instead of installing the same version, this time you can try the previous and beta ones, which can be easily found on[Guru3D.com](https://www.guru3d.com/files/index.html) .
