## 5\. Disable steam overlay

 You can try disabling Steam Overlay for Aliens: Fireteam Elite and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Aliens: Fireteam Elite_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Disable real-time protection from your antivirus software

 The real-time protection feature in some 3rd party antivirus software would block the game files, and this may lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application, and turn off the real-time protection feature. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Run Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.

## 7\. Run the System File Checker

 You also need to check the system file if the game still crashes, because the corrupted system files would also crash the game.

 You can run the System File Checker to check and repair the system files. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the **Run** dialog. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** , **Shift** , and **Enter** at the same time to open **Command Prompt** as administrator.
2. Type in the command below and press Enter to execute the command. The process will take some time.
