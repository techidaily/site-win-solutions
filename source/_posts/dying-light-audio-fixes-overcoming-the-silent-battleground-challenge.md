## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Switch programs & move the game to SSD](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Lower video settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Change NVIDIA settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Change priority](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Verify the game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1: Switch programs & move the game to SSD

 This tip is from a player who figured out if his frames drop, he can use the**Alt+Tab** shortcut to switch out and back in. After that, the game starts running flawlessly.

 Did you install the game in HDD or SSD? We recommend installing the game on SSD so the problem might go.

 Since the FPS issue varies from person to person, we can’t promise this tip is working for everyone, but it’s worth trying.

## Fix 2: Lower video settings

 Lowering some of the video settings would fix the FPS issue in some situations. Make sure you’ve closed all unnecessary programs running in the background before launching the game.

| **Resolution**            | 1366X768 |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| **Full Screen**           | OFF      |
| **Borderless Window**     | ON       |
| **Frame Rate Cap**        | UNCAPPED |
| **View Distance**         | LOW      |
| **Vsync**                 | OFF      |
| **Nvidia Depth of Field** | OFF      |

 It’s suggested to disable all NVIDIA options in the settings. These drain a lot of performance.

If this fix doesn’t help, move to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Change NVIDIA settings

 If you have a NVIDIA graphic card, change the NVIDIA program settings would fix the issue.

1. Open NVIDIA Control Panel. If you don’t have it,[download](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NF8H0H7WMLT) and install it.
2. Click**Manage 3D Settings > Program settings** .
3. Find Dying Light then select High performance NVIDIA processor.
4. Click**Apply** to save changes.
5. Reboot the game to check.

If it doesn’t help, move to the next fix.
