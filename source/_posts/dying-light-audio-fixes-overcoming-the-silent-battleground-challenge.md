If you got frame drops during the game for no reason, don’t worry, you’re not alone. This post has gathered all fixes that have been proved by other players.

 If you’re playing with a laptop, make sure you plugged in and charging while you play. Playing with charing makes a huge difference. Also, make sure you’ve met the minimum system requirement.

| **OS**               | Windows® 7 64-bit / Windows® 8 64-bit / Windows® 8.1 64-bit                  |

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Switch programs & move the game to SSD](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Lower video settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Change NVIDIA settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Change priority](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Verify the game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1: Switch programs & move the game to SSD

 This tip is from a player who figured out if his frames drop, he can use the**Alt+Tab** shortcut to switch out and back in. After that, the game starts running flawlessly.

 Did you install the game in HDD or SSD? We recommend installing the game on SSD so the problem might go.

 Since the FPS issue varies from person to person, we can’t promise this tip is working for everyone, but it’s worth trying.

## Fix 2: Lower video settings

 Lowering some of the video settings would fix the FPS issue in some situations. Make sure you’ve closed all unnecessary programs running in the background before launching the game.

| **Resolution**            | 1366X768 |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| **Full Screen**           | OFF      |
| **Borderless Window**     | ON       |
| **Frame Rate Cap**        | UNCAPPED |
| **View Distance**         | LOW      |
| **Vsync**                 | OFF      |
| **Nvidia Depth of Field** | OFF      |

 It’s suggested to disable all NVIDIA options in the settings. These drain a lot of performance.

If this fix doesn’t help, move to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Change NVIDIA settings

 If you have a NVIDIA graphic card, change the NVIDIA program settings would fix the issue.

1. Open NVIDIA Control Panel. If you don’t have it,[download](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NF8H0H7WMLT) and install it.
2. Click**Manage 3D Settings > Program settings** .
3. Find Dying Light then select High performance NVIDIA processor.
4. Click**Apply** to save changes.
5. Reboot the game to check.

If it doesn’t help, move to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Update your driver

 Graphic card and its driver are related to the FPS issue. The outdated or wrongly installed driver might be the culprit of the issue. Therefore, make sure you have the latest drivers installed on your computer is important. What’s more, updating your drivers would improve your computer performance.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can spend some time updating drivers manually by visiting your GPU manufacturer’s official websites and search for the latest driver which suits your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

## Fix 5: Change priority

 Some players found changing the game priority would fix the FPS issue. Although some players said it’s a partial fix, it’s worth trying. Follow the steps below to get rid of the FPS drop issue.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open Task Manager.
2. Go to the**Details** tab and find the DyingLightGame.exe file.
3. Right-click on it and select**Set priority > Realtime** or**High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_16-56-17.jpg)
4. Reboot the game and change Game Settings to**Windowed Full-Screen** mode.

5. Check the FPS.

 Next time, check the priority settings in the Task Manager before you play. Because it sometimes changes back to Normal.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

## Fix 6: Verify the game files

 Sometimes there’re some missing files that cause the FPS drop issue. You can fix it by Verify the game files.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Right-click on Dying Light and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_17-10-14.png)
3. Click**LOCAL FILES** and click**Verify integrity of game files…**
