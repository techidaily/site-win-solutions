## Fix 1: Check your network

 The Origin download requires a stable network. If you’re seeing slow speeds, it’s most likely an issue with your network. In this case, you can:

 1)**Restart your router** .

 Unplug your router and after one minute, plug it back in and make it reconnect.

 2)**Temporarily disconnect other devices** .

 With so many devices connected to your network, Origin download can be quite slow. So if possible, disconnect them while downloading.
