## Fix 1: Verify the game files

 The first fix you can try is to verify the game files via the game launcher. If the crashing issue was caused by any missing or corrupted game files, the verification process will make sure those files are added or replaced to solve the problem.

#### Steam

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Football Manager 2022 crashing randomly may indicate a driver issue. The latest graphics driver is usually required for most video games for them to run smoothly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Windows doesn’t detect the latest available update, you can search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Fix 3: Remove custom mods

 Any custom add-ons like mods, graphics, or skins, may interfere and cause the game to crash. If you installed the add-ons from the Steam workshop, you can easily unsubscribe from them and test the issue. Here’s how:

1. Go to your Steam profile page, and click**Workshop items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-29_10-51-25.png)
2. Click**(your username)’s Favorite** \>>**Select a game** \>>**Football Manager 2022** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-29_10-52-33.png)
3. You can**unsubscribe** from the mods one at a time to test which item was causing the problem.

If this doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Delete cache/preferences folders

 The developers suggest that you can delete your preferences and/or cache folder(s) as they may trigger random crashes. Deleting these folders won’t affect your game saves, but you’ll have to set up and apply your preference settings again.

1. Press the **Windows key** and **E** to open the File Explorer.
2. Click **View** in the header, and tick the box of **Hidden items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hidden-items.jpg)
3. Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\\[Your Username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Sports Interactive\\Football Manager 2022** .
4. Delete the **Preferences** and/or **Cache** folder(s).

 If you want to keep the preferences and cache files, you can move these folders to the desktop. As long as they’re not in the FM22 folder, you can run the game to test the issue.

If this fix doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Repair corrupted system files

 In addition to game files, corrupted system files may also cause Football Manager 2022 to crash. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system issues, but it could miss minor issues and most of the time, manual repair is required.

## Fix 6: Close unnecessary programs

 Unnecessary programs running in the background may interfere with game performance. Sometimes they could take up the resources required for Football Manager 2022 to run smoothly, and thus causing the crashing issue.

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click **Task Manager** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Check your antivirus software

 Aggressive antivirus software is a common cause of game crashes. If you’re using any antivirus software, you can try to:

* Add Football Manager 2022 game executable file and/or all the game folders to the whitelist/exceptions of the antivirus software.
* Temporarily disable your antivirus tool and test the issue.

 Disabling your antivirus program may expose your PC to risks, even if it’s just temporary. So make sure you don’t download anything suspicious from the internet when your PC is not under protection.

 If you’ve configured your antivirus software but Football Manager 2022 still crashes on your PC, try the next fix.

 In addition to antivirus software, you can also check out [the list of programs that may affect Steam game performance](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1F39-DCB4-FF28-5748) .

## Fix 8: Make sure your system is up-to-date

 Windows regularly rolls out updates to fix known bugs and compatibility issues with programs on your PC. Here’s how to check for Windows updates and install the available ones:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type **update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for available system updates. If there are _no_  available updates, you’ll get a **You’re up to date** sign. You could also click **View all optional updates** and install them if needed.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299" border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-update.jpg)
4. You will be prompted to restart your PC. Make sure you save important files in advance.

## Fix 9: Change the game folder location

 Sometimes a random game crash can be solved by backing up and moving your game files. Although the Steam client now has a built-in feature to help players do this, there’s no similar feature in Epic Games Launcher. Here we’ll introduce the manual way to do it, which only takes a few steps and will work on both game launchers:

1. Right-click an empty area on your desktop, select **New** and click **Folder** . You can name this new folder as “FM22 backup” to distinguish it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/new-folder.jpg)
2. Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\\[Your Username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Sports Interactive\\Football Manager 2022** .
3. Cut all the folders here and paste them into the new folder you created on the desktop.
4. Launch Football Manager 2022 to test the issue. If the problem is solved, you can copy the game files back to the original installation path.

If this doesn’t help, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 10: Reinstall Football Manager 2022

 Some players were able to solve the crashing issue after they reinstalled FM22, and it’s definitely worth a try. This is most likely to work when the previous game download or installation was interrupted and thus triggered the crashes.
