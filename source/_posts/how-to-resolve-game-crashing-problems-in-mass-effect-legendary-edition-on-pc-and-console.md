### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your issue.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-02.jpg)

### Fix 3: Turn off unnecessary programs

 So, it’s recommended that you close unneeded programs while gaming. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.
