<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once done, relaunch the game to check if the black screen issue still occurs.

If the issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The black screen issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix the potential problem and ensure your game works properly, you’ll need to make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

If this fix doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.

### Fix 4: Disable the Ubisoft Connect overlay

 Some players have reported that they fixed the freezing or black screen issues by disabling the Ubisoft Connect overlay. Besides, your game performance might be improved as well. Here’s how:

1. Open Ubisoft Connect and click the**three lines** in the top left corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ubisoft-three-lines.jpg)

3. Under the**General** tab, uncheck**Enable in-game overlay for supported games** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ubisoft-uncheck-overlay.jpg)

Launch Far Cry 6 again to see if your problem disappears.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 5: Switch to windowed mode

 If the black screen issue was caused due to a small glitch, you can try to fix it by switching to windowed mode. This workaround has been proven useful by many gamers and you can give it a shot. Simply press**ALT+Enter** to switch to windowed mode while in full screen.

 This should fix your black screen issue with Far Cry 6\. But if not, continue to the next fix.
