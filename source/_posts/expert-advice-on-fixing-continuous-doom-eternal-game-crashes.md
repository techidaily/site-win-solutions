## Verify and repair game files

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **Library** .
2. **Right-click** on **WARNO** and select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
3. Click **LOCAL FILES** on the left, then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . If Steam finds anything wrong with the game files, it will re-download them from its official server.  
![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 Launch WARNO after the verifying process is complete. See if it crashes again. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If WARNO keeps crashing on your PC, it’s likely that you have the corrupted or outdated graphics driver on your PC. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the game crashing issues.

 You can update manually: first go to the manufacturer’s download page ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), then search your model and download the correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

![Driver Easy scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Driver-Easy-scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Install the latest WARNO patch

 Eugen Systems, the developer of WARNO releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance.

![WARNO new patch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WARNO-new-patch-1105x1200.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it. If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run WARNO again and check if the game crashes get fixed. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 Overlays are handy. However, sometimes the overlay would interfere with the game and even block the game files.

 If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling Steam Overlay for WARNO and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _WARNO_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc.), ensure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature.

 Launch WARNO and see if the it crashes again. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Many 3rd party antivirus software often block important game files. You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch WARNO and see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## Repair corrupted system files

 Windows system file corruption will also lead the game to crash. If you’ve played PC games for years, you may have already known that even a missing or corrupted .dll file (dynamic link libraries) would cause a game to crash.

![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration5.png)

 After enabling each services, you need to restart your PC to apply the changes.
