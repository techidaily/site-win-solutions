### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 The most common cause of Escape from Tarkov FPS drops is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. GPU manufacturers keep optimizing their drivers for the latest titles. So we recommend you check for the driver update regularly to ensure smooth gameplay.

 You could update the graphics driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ) and searching for the driver that’s right for your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan** **Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update** **All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update** **All** ). Or you can click**Update** to update the graphics driver for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amd-6800xt.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Normally you should see a significant performance improvement after you update all the device drivers on your computer. But if not, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close unnecessary background programs

 If you’ve launched several programs such as Chrome or Discord while you’re playing Escape from Tarkov, they will consume your system resources and thus your game renders in low FPS. Before gaming, try to shut down all the unnecessary programs running in the background.

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
2. Right-click a program and click**End task** to close them one by one.  
 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-3.jpg)

 If no programs are consuming your CPU or GPU but FPS drops reoccur, try the third fix.

### Fix 3 – Change the PC power plan

 Your gaming experience may be limited when your computer runs on the Power saver or Balanced power plan. For enhanced performance, it’s better to opt for High Performance.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**powercfg.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/change-power-plan-1-1.jpg)
2. Select**High** **performance** . (If you don’t see it, expand**Hide additional plans** .)

<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/change-power-plan-2-1.jpg)

 If you’re on a high-end PC, the**Ultimate Performance** mode may help you fully unleash the potential of your machine. Here’s how to enable this mode.

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows search box and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ultimate-performance-1.jpg)
2. In the command prompt, type or paste the following command and press **Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61

 When you see a prompt as shown in the picture, Ultimate Performance is enabled and please return to the steps above to set it as your preferred plan.

### Fix 4 – Disable fullscreen optimizations

 Fullscreen optimization is supposed to optimize the performance of games or apps in fullscreen. However, certain games might stutter with FPS drops when this feature is enabled, and turning it off could effectively mitigate the problem.

1. Go to the game directory of Escape from Tarkov.
2. Right-click the**EscapeFromTarkov.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-fullscreen-optimizations-0.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab and tick**Disable full-screen optimisations** . Then, click**Change high DPI settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-fullscreen-optimizations-1.jpg)
4. Tick**Override high DPI scaling behaviour** and choose**Application** from the drop-down menu. Then, click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-fullscreen-optimizations-2.jpg)

 Launch EFT to check the game performance. If this gives you no luck, there are two more fixes to try.

### Fix 5 – Adjust the in-game graphics settings

 Many players reported their in-game settings have been reset after the latest patch. So if you’re getting a lot of stutters or FPS drops, you should fine-tune the setting to make it work best on your rig.

1. Launch Escape from Tarkov and click the**gear icon** at the bottom right corner to enter the Settings menu.
2. On the**GRAPHICS** tab,**turn off VSync** . Then set the_Texture quality_ to high and_Shadows quality_ to**low** or**medium** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tarkov-settings-1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to turn on**Mip Streaming** .
4. Navigate to the**GAME** tab and uncheck**Always show interface elements** ,**Auto RAM Cleaner** as well as**Use only the physical cores** .
