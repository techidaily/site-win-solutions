 Here are the**minimum specs** needed to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare:

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | Intel Core i3-4340 or AMD FX-6300                           |
| **Memory**           | 8GB RAM                                                     |
| **Video**            | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 / GeForce GTX 1650 or Radeon HD 7950 |
| **Sound Card**       | DirectX Compatible                                          |

### Fix 2 – Avoid PC overheating

 Modern Warfare is a graphic-intensive application that will put load on your CPU and GPU. When these component overheats, the computer will stop functioning to protect the hardware from physical damage, and thus your game freezes.

 To avoid this, you should**clean the dust regularly** and**make sure your cooling system is up and running** .

 If your game just freezes without any overheating symptoms, check the fix below.

### Fix 3 – Close background applications

 When programs running in the background interfere with Modern Warfare or consume too much resource, freezing issues will occur. So before you start a match, try to shut down all unnecessary background applications. Here’s how to do this:

**1)** Right-click the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856" border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1-5.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the application you want to close and click**End task** .

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Launch Modern Warfare to test if it runs smoothly enough to complete a match. If not, head towards Fix 4.

### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, you may run into various gaming issues such as freezes, lags and crashes. To enjoy the optimal performance of an AAA game like Modern Warfare, you should always have the latest graphics driver installed.

 There are mainly two ways to update the graphics driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix incompatibility issues with games. If you want to get them by yourself, you may spend some time searching and installing.

**1)** Download the latest and correct drivers from the manufacturer’s websites such as:

* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

**2)** Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instruction to install the driver manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-1-4.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

### Fix 5 – Scan and repair game files

 Missing or corrupted game files are also common culprits of game crashes or freezes, but it’s not difficult to repair them.

Here are the steps:

**1)** Open the Battle.net app, and click**Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** on the left pane.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-0-0-1200x741.jpg)

**2)** Click**Options** and select**Scan and Repair** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-0-1.jpg)

**3)** Click**Begin Scan** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-3-1.jpg)

 This will automatically scan and repair any missing or corrupted game files. After the process completes, relaunch Modern Warfare and check for the issue. If this doesn’t help, go for the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6 – Change in-game graphics settings

 Many players will maximize the in-game settings for the best experience, but that could overload your GPU and increase the risk of freezing. Lowering the graphics may make your game more fluid.

**1)** Launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and enter the**Options** menu.

**2)** Select the**Graphics** tab. Then, click**Display Mode** and select**Fullscreen** from the drop-down menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-4.jpg)

**3)** Disable**Sync Every Frame (V-Sync)** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-2-3.jpg)

**4)** Scroll down to the**Details & Textures** tab, and configure the settings as below:

* Texture Resolution:**Medium** or**Low**
* Texture Filter Anisotropic:**Low**
* Particle Quality:**Low**
* Bullet Impacts and Sprays:**Disabled**
* Tessellation:**Disabled**

**5)** Click**Apply Settings** .

 These settings are expected to balance your game performance and visual quality. You could gradually increase the settings to test which combination works the best and won’t trigger critical problems. If the lower settings don’t work, try**Reset tab to Default** .

 If Modern Warfare still freezes no matter how you change the settings, turn to the next method.

### Fix 7 – Disable in-game overlay

 Many gamers reported the overlay feature would lead to Modern Warfare freezing. So you should disable it on **[GeForce Experience](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to solve your problem.

#### On GeForce Experience

**1)** Run GeForce Experience.

**2)** Click the**cogwheel icon** at the upper right corner.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1-1-2.jpg)

**3)** Toggle off**In-game overlay** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-00.jpg)

#### On Discord

**1)** Run Discord, and click the**cogwheel icon** at the bottom of the left pane.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-2-1-1.jpg)

**2)** Select the**Overlay** tab on the left pane, and toggle off**Enable in-game overlay** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-2-2-1.jpg)

 If you want to disable the overlay feature just for Modern Warfare, navigate to the**Games** tab on the left pane, and click the**computer icon** next to Modern Warfare to**toggle off overplay** .

 Launch Modern Warfare to see if the freezing issue disappears. If things don’t get any better after you turn off the overlay, check out the last fix.

### **Fix 8 – Reinstall Modern Warfare**

 If none of the preceding solutions resolves Modern Warfare freezing, try reinstalling the game as a last resort.

**1)** Run Battle.net application, and click**Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** on the left pane.
