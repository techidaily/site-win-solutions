![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 Launch Dread Hunger after the verifying process is complete. See if it crashes again. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If Dread Hunger keeps crashing on your PC, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver on your PC. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the game crashing issues.

 You can update your graphics driver manually: first, go to the manufacturer’s download page ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) / [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), then search your model and download the correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.

![Driver Easy scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Driver-Easy-scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  

![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

## Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Dread Hunger releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Dread Hunger again and check if this fix works. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 Although overlays are handy, sometimes they would interfere with the game and even block the game files, which may cause the game to crash.

 If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling Steam Overlay for Dread Hunger and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Dread Hunger_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Nvidia GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, etc.), make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps features.

 Run the game and see if it crashes again. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Dread Hunger will crash if some important game files are blocked by those 3rd party antivirus software. If you’re using 3rd-party antivirus software, try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch Dread Hunger to see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix, below.
