You can go to their websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , find the latest driver corresponding with your operating system, and download it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

### Fix 2 – Optimize graphics settings

 If you’re using a laptop or multi-GPU system, make sure the dedicated GPU is properly utilized. If not, you’ll see huge FPS drops and it’s better to tweak the settings for maximum performance

1. In the Windows search box, type**graphics settings** and select**Graphics settings** from the result.

### Fix 3 – Verify integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files could also lead to annoying issues like Elden Ring FPS drops. Before moving on to the more advanced steps, you could check if there’s something wrong with your game files and repair it automatically in Steam. Here are the steps:

1. Launch your Steam client and select the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Elden Ring** from the game list and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1-1.jpg)
3. Select**LOCAL FILES** and click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

 It may take a while for Steam to scan and repair the game files, which will replace the wrong files with those from the official server. Now check if you get smoother gameplay. If not, try the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Disable Steam overlay

 The in-game overlay is another common cause of FPS-related issues. You could simply turn it off and see if this helps improve the performance.

1. Open Steam and click**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. From the game list, right-click Elden Ring and select**Properties** .

### Fix 5 – Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator
