## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 DirectX errors in Battlefield 2042 usually suggest a driver issue. Some of the error messages directly ask you to install the latest graphics driver.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Windows fails to detect the latest available update, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install the driver correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. If updating the graphics driver doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Repair game files

 Another quick fix you can try is to repair your game files. If any files are missing or corrupted, the Origin client will add or replace the problematic files for you. Here’s how:

1. Launch Origin, and click**My Game Library** .
2. Right-click Battlefield 2042, then click**Repair Game** .
3. This process may take a while. Restart Origin and run Battlefield 2042 after the repair is complete.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Install the latest Windows updates

 According to players’ reports, updating the system has solved the DirectX errors for them. Keeping your system up-to-date may solve compatibility issues and improve stability. This fix may make a difference if your DirectX errors were triggered by Windows issues.

 If you’re on Windows 10, it’s not required to update to Windows 11 because it’s not a guaranteed fix, plus it may cause issues for your other games. Some players specifically pointed out that installing the**Windows 20H2 or 21H1 updates** was helpful.

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will search for available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation.

 If you encounter issues while using the Windows Update client, you can[manually download the updates from the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) .

 If updating your system doesn’t solve the errors for you, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Force-run DirectX 12

 Per the system requirement, Battlefield 2042 requires DirectX version 12, and the game should run DirectX 12 by default. But we all have different setups on our PC, and it’s possible that Battlefield 2042 isn’t running the right version of DirectX on your PC. You can manually enable DirectX12 and force the game to use it. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows key** and**E** on your keyboard to open the file explorer.
2. Navigate to**C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\Documents\\Battlefield 2042\\** .
3. Find the document named**PROFSAVE\_profile** . Make a copy of this document before tweaking anything, so you’re able to revert the changes in case you need to.
4. Right-click the document and open it with**notepad** .
5. Find the line**GstRender.Dx12Enabled 0** , and**change the value 0 to 1** .
6. Save the changes and launch Battlefield 2042 to test the issue.

 If force-running DirectX 12 for Battlefield 2042 doesn’t help, move on to the next fix.
