1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** .**right-click** on _Hell Let Loose_ . Then select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck**Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch HLL and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 See if HLL crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix failed to resolve this issue, try the next fix, below.
