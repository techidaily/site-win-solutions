### Fix 1\. Check the status of Epic Games server

 Sometimes you run into error codes because the servers are down. This can be a temporary situation so you can check the status of servers before you try any of these workarounds below.

* **Check the status of servers:**  
[status.epicgames.com](https://status.epicgames.com/)
* **Check their Trello board for issues:**

 The downtime always begins a few days before a major update. If the services for**Parties, Friends and Messaging** are under maintenance, you can just wait for the new release, or follow their[Twitter account](https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus) to get the live status of Fortnite.

### Fix 3\. Change the skin

 Though it seems absurd to you, changing the skin has indeed fixed the error code 84 for some players when they can’t join their friends’ party.

1. Log out of Fortnite and log back in.
2. Click on the **Locker** tab at the top menu.
3. Select**OUTFITS** , and select any of the available Skin in your inventory. You can further customize the style if you want to.
4. Click**SAVE AND EXIT** and Fortnite will apply the Skin to your character.

 You can join a game and wait until you are in the lobby. Accept the invite to join the party and test if the error code 84 persists.

### Fix 4\. Change the lobby to Public

 Another workaround you can try is to set your lobby to Public and then you can join without an invite.

 Simply head over to the lobby setting, and click the hamburger icon in the top-right, and set your**Party Privacy** to**Public** .

### Fix 5\. Join friends using the Epic Games list

 If the invite system is down, you can bypass it by adding them to your friends’ list. This will help you get around this issue.

 But if the host of the lobby you’re trying to join is already on your friends’ list, you can skip this fix.

### Fix 6\. Reinstall the game

 No matter where you play the game, reinstalling the game always does the trick for a few players. Consoles and mobile devices are closed systems, meaning there aren’t many troubleshooting options to fix issues you’re having. The most common fix is to reinstall Fortnite.
