 Check if this method helped in speeding up Steam. If Steam still runs slow, try the fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 Outdated or faulty device drivers can also cause Steam to lag. To see if that’s the problem for you, try updating your drivers. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer website of your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your computer, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-17_12-11-59-5.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the driver you need to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-17_12-12-06-1.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Restart Steam to test your issue.

If your problem persists, then move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 4: Disable auto proxy settings

 Incorrect proxy settings can cause connection issues such as slow webpage load speed.**For those who don’t use a proxy at all** , follow the instructions below to disable the automatic detection of a proxy service to see if that fixes your issue.

**If you already have a proxy server** that uses automatic configuration, you should skip this method and try **[Fix 5](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; otherwise, you might**lose network connections** after you disable the automatic detection setting.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**internet options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-806.png)

**2)** Click**Internet Options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-807.png)

**3)** Click the**Connections tab** , and then click**LAN settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-775.png)

**4)** Uncheck**Automatically detect settings** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-776.png)

 If you lose your network connections after you change your proxy settings, return to the LAN Settings window to re-enable the automatic detection setting.

**5)** Restart Steam client to test your issue.

If this didn’t resolve your problem, move on and try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Repair the Steam service

 Corrupt or missing Steam files may also Steam performance issues. To fix it, you’ll need to verify Steam files. Here is how:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time.

**2)** Type**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\bin\\SteamService.exe /repair** , then hit the**Enter** key on your keyboard.
