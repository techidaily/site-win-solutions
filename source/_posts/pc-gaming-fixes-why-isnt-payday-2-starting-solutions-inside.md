## 1\. Update Flawless Widescreen

 If you’re using Flawless Widescreen on your PC, this plugin seems the culprit of the crashes. The development team has recognized the issue and fixed it in their latest update. But if you still encounter crashes, you can turn off the**Scanning Fix** checkbox from the Flawless Widescreen plugin and try the game again.

## 2\. Update your drivers

 Outdated or corrupted drivers are the common reason for game crashing, therefore, make sure you have the most up-to-date drivers, especially for graphics and sound card drivers.

There are two ways to find the correct and the latest driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) and install it manually.  
 The manual driver update is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. So if you prefer a stress-free process, check out the second option below.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your computer for the changes to take effect, and then check Atomic Heart again. It should be running properly. If not, move to the next fix.

## 3\. Kill WindowsExplorer.exe

 Some gamers found if you’re playing through the game pass, you can kill the WindowsExplorer.exe in the task manager to fix Atomic Heart crashing issue.

1. Open Task manager by pressing Alt+Del+Shift together.
2. Find Windows Explorer.exe task and end it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/end-task-windows-explorer.jpg)
3. Play the game again to check for crashes.

 You can get WindowsExplorer.exe back by opening Task Manager again, then click**File > Run new task** **\>** **type explorer.exe** and hit enter.

## 4\. Verify file integrity

 If you purchased the game through a digital storefront, try verifying the integrity of the game files. This can help fix any corrupted files that may be causing the crashes. The process of “verify file integrity” will check your game installation and repair the corrupted game files. After the process, all the files for the game should be intact.

1. Launch the Steam client and go to Library.
2. Right-click Atomic Heart and select**Properties** .

3. Click the**Local Files** tab, then select**Verify Integrity of Game Files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/verify-game-files.jpg)
4. When it’s done, relaunch Steam and the game.

If it doesn’t help, move to the next fix.

## 5\. Lower graphical settings

 Even if your system meets the minimum specifications for the game, increasing the settings will put more workload on your hardware. If your graphics settings are too high for your system, this can cause the game to crash.

 You can run Atomic Heart at medium or lower graphical settings and see if the issue goes away. Some gamers reported they were able to get through the_March Of Flowers_ quest without crashes by turning down all graphics settings to the minimum (including resolution) and turning off DLSS Super Resolution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Repair system files

 Problematic system files (e.g. missing DLLs) can also affect the smooth launching and operation of the system and game. To check if your PC has flawed system files, you may want to run a quick and thorough scan with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It a software that’s equipped with powerful technology for securing and repairing PCs to an optimized state. Specifically, it **replaces damaged Windows files** , removes malware threats, detects dangerous websites, frees disk space, and so on. All the replacement files come from a full database of certified system files.

Take a look at how it works:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.

<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-1.jpg)
3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**START REPAIR** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.

 After the repairs, restart your computer and Atomic Heart to see if it fixes the problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Disable third-party software

 Other software running on your computer, such as antivirus or firewall software, can conflict with the game and cause it to crash. Some antivirus software may block certain game files which causes difficulties in launching Atomic Heart on your PC. You can temporarily disable your antivirus software to determine whether game crashing is caused by your antivirus software. If that’s the culprit, check your antivirus support page or help for a ‘gaming mode’ or similar option and enable that prior to playing. Or use another anti-malware software.

 Also, some applications require significant system resources, disabling or uninstalling any unnecessary software. This may change the game’s performance or stability.

## 8\. Reinstall the game

 If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling the game. This can help fix any issues that may have occurred during the installation process.

1. Open Steam and click on Library.
2. Right-click the game and select**Uninstall** .
3. After the process completes, you can reinstall the game by left-clicking on the game name within your Library and selecting Install from the game page that appears.

 If none of the above steps work, contact the game’s support team for further assistance. They may be able to provide you with more specific troubleshooting steps.
