### Fix 2\. Run your game as admin

 In case lacking administrative privileges cause your Far Cry 6 not to start, we recommend that you run the game executable file and game launcher (Ubisoft Connect / Epic Games Launcher) as an administrator.

1. Close any game-related apps. Then Right-click your Ubisoft Connect and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/properties.jpg)
2. Go to the **Compatibility**  tab and

![run ubisoft as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/run-as-admin.jpg)
3. Click **Apply** \> **OK** .
4. Also, repeat step 1\~2 for the Far Cry.exe file.

 Try restarting the game and see if it helps with the ‘Far Cry 6 not launching’ issue. If not, don’t worry since we have a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 3\. Verify your games files

 Corrupted game files can cause your game not to launch, and it’s easily done by verifying your game files. Here’s how:

 Close Ubisoft Connect, and then go to _**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Ubisoft\\Ubisoft Game Launcher**_ and delete the **Cache** folder.

 Launch Ubisoft Connect and check if Far Cry 6 still crashes like before. If this method doesn’t work, you can **uninstall** Ubisoft Connect to further troubleshoot the problem. But remember to [make a backup](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/manually-backing-up-ubisoft-connect-pc-save-files/000063179) beforehand.

 To **install** Ubisoft Connect PC:

1. Download the latest version of [Ubisoft Connect PC](https://ubi.li/4vxt9) .
2. Run the installer you downloaded with administrator rights.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Fix 4\. Update your GPU driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated GPU driver, you will get constant game crashes while playing Far Cry 6\. This is especially the case if you’re using a 30-series graphics card.

 AMD and NVIDIA keep releasing new drivers to add more features or fix some known bugs. To make sure it works to its best in-game performance, you will always need to ensure it’s up to date.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer, and installing it step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install it manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![scan drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scan-now-5.7.0.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
