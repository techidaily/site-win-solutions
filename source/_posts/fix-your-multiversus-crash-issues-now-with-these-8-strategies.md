### Fix 1 – Upgrade your drivers

 Updating your driver is the go-to option for crashing issues. The manufacturer releases new drivers to maintain the graphics cards, speed up your PC and boost the computer’s performance. Big manufacturers like AMD and NVIDIA sometimes release new drivers for particular games. However, the Windows system doesn’t always give you the latest version, with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter issues like game crashing, freezing, lagging, and more.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 Manufacturer official website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) releases new drivers on a regular basis, you need to find exactly the right driver that suits your specific operating system online, then download it and install it step by step.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3 – Change game settings

 This fix has worked for some users: changed these settings and they never had stutters or crashes again.

1) In Diablo 4, exit your current game session.

2) Press the ESC key to open the Game Mene. Then click the**OPTIONS** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/diablo-4-menu-options.png)

 2) Under the**Graphics** tab, in the**Performance** section, make sure NVIDIA DLSS is NOT set to DLAA (anything but DLAA). And disable the**NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency** .

 3) In the**Quality** section, Set**Shadow Quality** and**SSAO Quality** to Mid.

 4) Move to the**Social** tab. Simply uncheck**Cross-Network Play** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crossplay.jpg)

 5) Save the changes and back to the game, check if the game will crash again.

### Fix 4 – Remove overclocking

 Overclocking can increase a component to speed up its performance, but it can also be the culprit of game crashing. Some gamers reported that overclocks are the cause of the Diablo 4 crashing issue, hence, remove the overclock (if you’re overclocked) to see if it fixes the issue for you.

 To remove overclocking, you must reset BIOS to default. Here’s how:

1. Search for the key to access the BIOS menu online. The key differs from PC to PC, so you have to find the right key to enter BIOS settings.
2. Restart your PC, and press the key repeatedly when you see the logo appears on the screen.
3. Select BIOS Setup to access the BIOS.
4. Find the reverting to default option in BIOS settings, select it, save changes, and exit.  
 If you can’t find the option, find the Advanced tab, go to Performance and look for CPU overclocking. Then disable it and save changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5 – Close or uninstall conflicts apps

 Blizzard suggests gamers close all other applications while playing Diablo 4 to resolve application conflicts and free up resources. And there are gamers who reported several software which conflict with Diablo 4.

 If you have Wallpaper Engine, Razer Connect, HD texture pack, or other software skyrocketing when you played Diablo 4, disable them and check if the game will crash again.

1) Right-click on the taskbar and select Task Manager.

![open task manager from the taskbar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/task-manager-from-the-taskbar.jpg)

2) Check which apps consume a big amount of CPU/Memory.

3) Right-click on the suspicious app and select End task.

### Fix 7 – Repair system files

## Diablo 4 crashing fixes for PS5/Xbox

 Many PS5 and Xbox gamers say they’ve encountered constant crashes. They have to start restarting the game after each dungeon which is annoying. Restarting works for PS5, but that’s not a permanent fix.

### Fix 1 – Free up storage

 If your storage is nearly full, you can clear up some space and see if it helps. The full storage might be a cause of the game crashing.

 You can delete or remove data to other storage spaces, but it’s better to leave more than half storage in the[extended storage drive](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-manage-storage-space/) .

### Fix 2 – Disable crossplay

 Just like PC, disabling Cross-Network Play on PS5 also helps end up crashes.

 1) ON your console, press the Start button on your controller to open the Game menu.

 2) Tap the Options button.

 3) Head to the Social tab.

 4) Uncheck the Cross-Network Play and then restart the game. Check if it fixes your problem.

 That’s all about how to fix Diablo 4 crashing problem. Hope this post has solved your problem and let you back to game again.
