#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
