 But if you don’t have the time or patience to install manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

6. Restart your PC for the change to take effect.

If this fix doesn’t bring luck, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Underclock your GPU core

 Many gamers overclock graphics cards for better performance. Usually, the higher you overclock your GPU, the more processing power you get. But for the New World freezing issue, underclocking your GPU core could be the solution.

 It sounds strange, but it works for some people and it’s worth trying.

1. [Download](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) MSI Afterburner.
2. Install MSI Afterburner.
3. Open the software and find your graphics card.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/msi-afterburner-featured.jpg)
4. Because of the different PC environments, you may need to keep adjusting the Core Clock until you’re no longer freezing.  

 Here we suggest underclocking your GPU Core Clock by 400 MHz and memory clock 500 MHz.
5. In MSI Afterburner, change your power limit to 80%.
6. Save the profile and relaunch New World to check.

If it’s still not working, try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Lower your graphics settings

 The freezing issue usually relates to the graphics settings, some players indicate after they capped their FPS and lower graphics settings, the freezing issue was gone.  
 Here’s how:

1. Open New World. On the top right corner, click the **gear icon** to open settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-change-graphics-1.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select **Visuals** . Then set **Max FPS** 60 fps.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 In most cases, 60 fps is enough. But some gamer replies they’ve lower to 30 FPS.
