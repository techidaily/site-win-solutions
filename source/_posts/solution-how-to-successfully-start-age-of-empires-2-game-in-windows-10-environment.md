## How to Successfully Install Minecraft on Your Windows 11 Device - Solved

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Minecraft-not-installing.png)

 Minecraft is a sandbox-style game with open online play fosters creativity, which attracts a large number of players to dive into this game. However, users start to complain that this game cannot even be installed on Windows 11\. This can be quite frustrating. If you’re on the same boat, no worries. Here we’ve put together some fixes for you to try.

## Before getting started…

 Before tweaking the settings below, we suggest you**restart your computer** . Rebooting is a troubleshooting step and quick fix to many issues by wiping away the current state of the software, flushing RAM and clearing up temporary files and processes.

 However, if a simple restart doesn’t do the trick, you can**try installing Minecraft from the Microsoft Store Library** .

If that doesn’t work for you, try the fixes below.

## Try these fixes…

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Allow Minecraft installer through firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Download & install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Run Windows Store troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Run a full scan of your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Allow Minecraft installer through firewall

 The Windows Firewall is a built-in application that protects users from internet-based threats. However, sometimes it may mistakenly prevent trustworthy software from making changes on your system. To check if that’s your case, you can manually add Minecraft installer to the list of bypassing the firewall. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left menu, select**Privacy & security** . Then click**Windows Security** .

4. Scroll down and find**Allow an app through firewall** . Then click it.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/allow-an-app-through-firewall.png)
5. Make sure Minecraft is on the list and the**Private** and**Public** options are checked. If it’s not on the list, that means Minecraft doesn’t have access and you’ll need to click on the**Change settings** button. Then follow the on-screen instructions to add the Minecraft executable file to the list.

## 5\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If all else fails, it’s time you check whether you have missing or corrupted system files, which will negatively affect your system’s performance and even trigger some errors. In this situation, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to run the command sfc /scannow. But most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **Download** and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with full technical support. If you encounter any issues when using Fortect, feel free to contact their support team.

 Upon the completion of the repair, try to install Minecraft and you should be able to do it successfully.
