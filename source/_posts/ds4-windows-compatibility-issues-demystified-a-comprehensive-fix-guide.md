## 1\. Check your computer specs

 If your RoboCop: Rogue City doesn’t launch, the first thing you should do is to make sure that your computer is above the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for RoboCop: Rogue City to run smoothly.

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information:[**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

Here are the requirements for RoboCop: Rogue City for your reference:

| Minimum   | Recommended                                                                |                                                                              |

## 2\. Turn on Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows**  key and the **I** key at the same time to open Settings.
2. Select **Gaming** , and make sure that the toggle for **Game Mode** is set to **On** . Then click the **Graphics** tab.

 Run RoboCop: Rogue City now to see if it launches well. Some also mentioned that turning off Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling helps RoboCop: Rogue City to launch. So you can try this too to see if it works for you.

 If RoboCop: Rogue City still refuses to launch, please move on to the next fix, below.

## 3\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your RoboCop: Rogue City not launching problem, so if the above two methods don’t help RoboCop: Rogue City to launch, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Try to run RoboCop: Rogue City again and see if the latest graphics driver helps it to launch. If this fix doesn’t work for you, try the next fix, below.

## 4\. Verify game files

 When a game refuses to launch on Steam, you can always try to verify the game files to make sure that the problem is not caused by faulty or corrupted game files. To do so:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In**LIBRARY** , right-click on RoboCop: Rogue City and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Installed Files** tab and click on the**Verified integrity of game files** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will then verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 When the verification is done, try to launch RoboCop: Rogue City again. If it’s still not launching, please move on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Add Steam and RoboCop to the antivirus exception list

 Given that third-party antivirus applications usually hook very deep into your system, they may interfere with Steam and its related services, and therefore stop RoboCop: Rogue City from launching properly.

 This is usually because Steam and the games consume a lot of memory and CPU usage when running, many third-party antivirus applications may regard them as potential threats and then force your system to shut them down.

 To make sure that your third-party antivirus program is not stopping RoboCop: Rogue City from launching on your computer, you can try   **adding Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you aren’t sure how to do it.

## 6\. Run Steam as admin

 It’s also possible that lacking certain system permissions is stopping Steam and RoboCop: Rogue City from running properly. To make sure that this is not why your RoboCop: Rogue City doesn’t launch, you can run Steam and RoboCop: Rogue City as administrator so as to give them all the privileges they may need to run. To do so:

1. Right-click your **Steam** icon and select **Properties** .

2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-57.png)

 Now open Steam and RoboCop: Rogue City again (it should be opened with administrative permission), to see if it launches well. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix.

---

## 7\. Modify the TDR value in the Registry Editor

 If RoboCop: Rogue City still doesn’t launch after all the above, you can try to modify the TDR value in the Registry Editor.

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here: [How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key together. Type **regedit** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-27.png)
3. Go to the following location: ``**Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\`GraphicsDrivers`**``

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-87.png)
4. On the right side, right-click the empty area and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-88.png)
5. Name the new entry **TdrLevel** , then double-click it and make sure that its **Value data** is**0** . Click OK to save.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-89.png)
6. Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

Then see if RoboCop: Rogue City can launch now.
