### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

_The Surge 2_ crashing issues are most likely to occur if you’re using the wrong video driver or the driver is out of date. So, updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your game. There are two ways you can do this:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your video card keeps updating drivers. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, such as **[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)**  , **[NVidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/update-3.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Restart your computer and your game after updating your graphics driver. Hope this helped in resolving your issue. If it didn’t. move on to the fix below.

**1)** Exit Steam.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

 The crashing issue might happen when your game is not properly installed on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try verifying the integrity of your game files to see if there are any damaged or missing game files.

### Fix 5: Change the compatibility setting

**1)** Right-click the Steam icon, then select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-219.png)

### Fix 6: Stop overclocking your CPU

 An unstable overclock will crash your game and the whole system. If you overclocked your GPU, that may be the issue. So, you should set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to see if it fixes your issue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Adjust your virtual memory

 In some cases, players encounter_The Surge 2_ crashing issues due to low RAM. But this doesn’t necessarily mean you should get a new RAM. This is when the paging file comes into play!

**Why do I need to optimize the page file?**
 If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, your programs are likely to crash.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-884-5.png)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-909-5.png)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .

### Fix 8: Check for Windows updates

 If a game won’t run at all, it’s unlikely that out-of-date Windows OS is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility.

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-575-6.png)
