4. [**Change the graphics settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Turn off the preview window

 According to many users, a simple workaround to OBS not recording screen is to disable the preview window. What you need to do is to launch OBS and untick the**Studio Mode** at the bottom right corner of the main screen. Then the preview window should be closed and you could check if the problem goes away. If the problem occurs while you’re recording a game, try to**minimize OBS** to the system tray.

 Turning off OBS preview should also mitigate the FPS drops while recording. But if this doesn’t help your case, have a look at the second method below.

### Fix 2 – Run OBS as an administrator

 If OBS doesn’t have proper administrator privileges, it will fail to record your screen as expected, but you could run it as an administrator to fix the issue.

1. Right-click the**OBS icon** on your desktop and select**Properties** .

2. Select the**Compatibility** tab, tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .

 Now OBS should be working with full access and recording your screen properly. If not so, there are a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 3 – Close unnecessary background programs

 Software conflicts can also be a cause. To avoid this, you should shut down all unneeded programs running in the background before using OBS. Here are the steps:

1. Right-click any empty area of the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

 See if OBS works without trouble. If you’re still unable to use screen capture, there might be something wrong with your device drivers. Check out Fix 5 to solve it.

### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 If none of the methods above resolves your problem, the cause can be driver-related. If your device drivers are missing, faulty or outdated, you may run into the OBS black screen issue and it won’t be able to record the screen properly. To update your device drivers, here are two ways for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : You can update the drivers manually by going to the hardware or PC manufacturer’s website and then searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** next to the flagged device driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 If driver update doesn’t give you luck, try reinstalling OBS to get rid of the in-depth bugs during the installation and see how things go.
