### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing issue is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. To run_FM19_ smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 6: Set Game Launch Options

 Game Launch Options allow you to change game settings before launching it. It’s helpful if your issue is caused by improper in-game settings, and you can’t run your game at all. Here are two options to try:

* **[Launch_FM19_ with the -renderer_direct3D9 option](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Launch_FM19_ with the -small_screen -windowed option](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 7: Change the power option

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and R at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-11-45-3.jpg)
