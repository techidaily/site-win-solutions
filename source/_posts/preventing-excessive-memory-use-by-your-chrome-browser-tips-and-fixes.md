2. Locate the**MonsterHunterRise.exe file** and select**Properties** .

 Directly launch the exe file to see how it works. If it still doesn’t start properly, try**running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8** . This is a simple workaround for many players.

Still no luck? Move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Allow your game through Controlled Folder Access and antivirus

 It’s also possible that Windows Security and other antivirus have prevented Monter Hunter Rise from running, and therefore the game fails to launch. To tweak the settings, follow the steps below:

1. On the Windows search box, type**windows security** and select**Windows Security** from the results.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/browse-all-apps.png)
5. Navigate to the game’s installation folder and add the**MonsterHunterRise.exe file** .

 If you have also installed any third-party anti-virus software like McAfee, Bitdefender and Avast, make sure your game is added to their whitelists and not blocked.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game bugs or not launching is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . A driver update can tackle compatibility issues of new games like Monster Hunter Rise and offer a zero-cost performance boost. So before you try anything more complicated, check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 You can update the GPU driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and downloading the latest driver corresponding with your system. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
