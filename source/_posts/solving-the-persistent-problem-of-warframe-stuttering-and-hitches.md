## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you. The first three are some basic troubleshooting steps, you can skip these fixes if you’ve already tried them.

1. **[Verify game integrity](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable third-party software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Run Red Dead Online as admin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Stop overclocking your GPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Install Graphic Tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify game integrity

 The first thing to do when Red Dead Online crashes (or any game crashes) is to verify the game integrity. Corrupt or incomplete game files can cause your game to crash. To see if this is the culprit, here’s how:

1. Launch Steam.
2. Go to**Library** .
3. Locate Red Dead Online.
4. Right-click the game and select**Properties** .
5. Select the**Local files** tab and click the**Verify integrity of game files…** button.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-on-Steam-1.png)
6. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

If you’re on Rockstar game launcher, you can verify integrity by:

* Navigate to**Settings**
* Select Red Dead Online from the list under**My installed games** on the left
* Select**Verify Integrity** under Verify game file integrity from the options on the right

### Fix 2: Disable third-party software

 Some third-party tools or software can interfere with your Red Dead Online, especially if you’re using tools like MSI Afterburner or RGB software, OBS, and Bandicam. Open Task Manager (**Esc** +**Shift** +**Esc** ) to close all these background apps or simply uninstall them.

 In addition, another possible cause of Red Dead Online crashing is your**antivirus software** . Disabling some of these services won’t always work. You can temporarily uninstall the software or add Red Dead Online to its exclusions.

### Fix 3: Run Red Dead Online as admin

 Red Dead Online crashing can be caused by a lack of admin rights. So it’s recommended to run Red Dead Online as administrator.

1. Right-click the game’s executable file and select**Properties** .
2. Click the **Compatibility** tab, tick both **Run this Program as an Administrator** and **Disable Fullscreen Optimizations** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/drivereasy-run-as-admin.jpg)
3. Click**Apply** \>**OK** and now you can run this game as administrator permanently.

 Now launch Red Dead Online and see if the game crashes again. If running it as an administrator did not work, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix known bugs and add new features. Outdated or corrupt graphics drivers can cause your game to crash. For game players, it’s important to keep your graphics drivers (and sometimes sound card drivers) to make sure your game runs smoothly.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/red-dead-online-crashing-fix-pc/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

#### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics card

 To manually update your graphics driver, you can head to its official website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Note that you should download the driver for your operating system, and install it manually.

#### Option 2 –**Automatically update your drivers** (recommended)

 If you prefer to do it in a much easier way and update your graphics driver as soon as there’s an update, you can do it with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking your GPU

 If your Red Dead Online is still crashing, the reason might be your GPU. If you’re overclocking your GPU, you can revert it back to its default GPU clock.

 But if you don’t feel like messing with the GPU clock, you can lock the game’s max FPS instead.

1. Right-click the desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .
2. Go to**Manage 3D Settings** on the left pane. Then select**Program Settings** \> select**Red Dead Online** /**Red Dead Redemption 2** .  
![program settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/manage-3d-settings.png)
3. Turn on**Max FPS Limit** and set the value to**30** . This will lock the game to 30 FPS and will reduce CPU and GPU load.

### Fix 6: Install Graphics Tools

 Some players find adding a Graphics Tool helped fix their Red Dead Online crashing issue. So if these methods above didn’t do the trick, you may want to have a try:

1. In the Windows Search bar, start typing **feature** , and select **Manage** **optional features** .
2. Click **Add a feature** .  
![add graphics tools](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/add-a-feature-1.jpg)
3. Choose **Graphics Tools** from the results list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/add-a-graphics-tool.jpg)
4. Launch your game again to see if you can get rid of game crashes now.
5. If not, you can go to**Graphics Settings** \>**Advanced Graphics** , and make sure**Graphics API** is set to**DirectX 12** .  
![change Vulkan to DX12](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DX12.png)
6. If changing it to DX12 didn’t help, you can try reverting it back to Vulkan.
