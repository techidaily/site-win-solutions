Once done, launch Madden 21 and check if it crashes again.

If the fix doesn’t stop the crash, you can try the next one below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, game crashes are graphics related. In other words, the constant crashes could indicate you’re using a**buggy or outdated graphics driver** . New drivers usually tackle compatibility issues, so always make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver.

 Of course you can update your drivers manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), then search, download and install the driver step by step. But if you don’t like fiddling with device drivers, you can leave it to[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
