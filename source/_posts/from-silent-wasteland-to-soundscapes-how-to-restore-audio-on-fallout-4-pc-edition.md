1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Solution 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game issues is a missing or outdated graphics driver. So, if you’re encountering any issues with Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord, such as game crashes and lags, try updating your graphics driver. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**5)** Relaunch Steam to reinstall the game.

 If the Bannerlord still crashes on your PC, move on and try the solution below.

### Solution 4: Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the virtual memory is not sufficient to save temporary files, applications running on your PC might fail.

 In this case, follow the instructions below to increase the size of your virtual memory:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-884.png)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

* **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the **Recommended** category.
* **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4096 MB x 1.5).
