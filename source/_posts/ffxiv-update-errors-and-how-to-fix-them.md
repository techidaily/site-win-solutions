![discord javascript error](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/feature-image-5.jpg)

 If you encounter the**Discord JavaScript error** when you’re launching the program, don’t worry. Many users have reported the same problem and they managed to fix it with the methods below.

 You may not try them all; just work from the top down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Run Discord without the administrator rights](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Add Discord as an exception to your antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Configure the Quality Windows Audio Video Experience service](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Reinstall Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Run Discord without the administrator rights

 Some programs require administrator rights to work properly, yet that’s not always the case. To fix the JavaScript error, you can try running Discord without logging as an administrator.

**1)** Right-click Discord and click**Properties** .

 Launch Discord and see how it works. If the JavaScript error message reoccurs, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 2 – Add Discord as an exception to your antivirus

 If your anti-virus programs accidentally quarantine specific files that are necessary for Discord to install or launch correctly, the JavaScript error will occur. To solve this, you need to **add Discord and its related files to the exception list of your antivirus** .

**1)** Go to the virus chest of your anti-virus program and see if any Discord files are blocked.

**2)** If yes, restore these files and add them to the exclusion list. Then, navigate to the exclusion section, and whitelist all files related to Discord as well as the installation file.

 The process varies in different anti-virus applications. If you don’t know how to do this, please refer to the guide of your anti-virus program. If this method didn’t solve the JavaScript error, please try the next fix.

## Fix 3 – Configure the Quality Windows Audio Video Experience service

## Bonus tip: Update your device drivers

 If you constantly run into issues with Discord, such as a black screen or mic not working, it’s possible that your device drivers are missing, faulty or outdated, and you should keep them up-to-date at all times.

 There’re two ways you can update your device drivers: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 –**Download and install the drivers manually**

 You can get the latest device drivers directly from the manufacturers’ websites, but be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 –**Automatically update your device drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged device driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
