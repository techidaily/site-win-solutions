 After confirming your PC is good enough for Psychonauts 2, you can move on to the advanced troubleshooting below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver, also called a video card driver, is essential to the functioning of video games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re likely to encounter the crashing issue in Psychonauts 2\. To fix the potential problem and get the best performance out of your hardware, you should make sure your computer’s graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

If the issue persists, go ahead with the next fix.

If the crashing issue remains, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Launch the game in DX11 mode

 If you receive a “LowLevelFatalError” error message when Psychonauts 2 crashes, then try launching the game in DX11 mode. This was suggested by the game developers. To do so:

2. Right-click Psychonauts 2, select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psychonauts2-properties-1.jpg)
3. In the GENERAL section, enter**\-dx11** under LAUNCH OPTIONS.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-launch-options-dx11.jpg)

 This will force the game to run in DX11\. Then you can launch Psychonauts 2 again to see if the error still occurs.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix.
