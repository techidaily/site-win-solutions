 Directly launch the exe file to see how it works. If it still doesn’t start properly, try**running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8** . This is a simple workaround for many players.

Still no luck? Move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Allow your game through Controlled Folder Access and antivirus

 It’s also possible that Windows Security and other antivirus have prevented Monter Hunter Rise from running, and therefore the game fails to launch. To tweak the settings, follow the steps below:

1. On the Windows search box, type**windows security** and select**Windows Security** from the results.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game bugs or not launching is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . A driver update can tackle compatibility issues of new games like Monster Hunter Rise and offer a zero-cost performance boost. So before you try anything more complicated, check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 You can update the GPU driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and downloading the latest driver corresponding with your system. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

### Fix 4 – Disable resource-hogging programs

 If too many resource-hogging applications are running in the background, that may interfere with your game and make it crash or not open. It’s better to close these applications while playing Monster Hunter Rise. Here’s how:

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
2. Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what apps are consuming your resources most. Then right-click the process you want to end and select **End task** .
