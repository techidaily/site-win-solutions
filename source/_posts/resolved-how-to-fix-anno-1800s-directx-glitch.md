### Fix 2: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Anno 1800, Unisoft, keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent bug has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required for the problem. So it’s recommended that you go to **[Ubisoft official website](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/)**  , check for the latest patch, download and install it. Then check if it fixes the Anno 1800 game crash problem.

### Fix 3: Switch DirectX versions

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards. Some players suggest that switching the two DirectX versions help resolve the error: if you’re running DirectX 11 or below, it’s recommended that you update it to DirectX 12 (the latest version by the time of writing), and vice versa.
