 Then check to see if this restores your Steam download speed. If not, you may need to try a different download region.

 If changing download region doesn’t work for you at all, then you should try the fix below…

### Fix 3: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to the network connection of your Steam client. To see if that’s the case for you, temporarily disable your firewall and see if the problem remains. (You may need to consult your firewall documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, you can add your Steam client to the whitelist of your firewall. You can contact the vendor of your firewall and ask them for advice. Or you can install a different antivirus solution.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when you have disabled your firewall.
