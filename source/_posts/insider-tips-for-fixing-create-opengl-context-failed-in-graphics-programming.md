3. Once done, return to Mass Effect and test your gameplay.

If this doesn’t help, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes tend to be graphics related, which means that you could be using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . The remastered Mass Effect is graphically demanding, and having the latest graphics driver definitely gives you a leg up.

 You can update your graphics driver manually: Visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and search for your model, then find and download the latest correct installer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do that automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if Mass Effect crashes again.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t give you luck, you can continue to the next solution.

### Fix 3: Disable hardware monitors

 Some gamers suggested that hardware monitoring software could be interfering with the game and hence the crashes. When troubleshooting crashing issues, we recommend closing other programs so as to minimize the risk. In other words, if you’re using hardware monitors such as**MSI Afterburner** ,**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** and**AIDA64** , make sure they’re turned off before launching Mass Effect.

 Also make sure you’re not overclocking your hardware using apps or BIOS settings.

 If you’re not running any monitors nor overclocking, simply check out the next tips below.

### Fix 4: Disable all overlays

 Overlays is a feature that allows you to record in-game achievements or interact with friends. Convenient as they may be, they could also affect game stability. In this case, you can try disabling all these overlays and see how things go.

Now you can start Mass Effect and test the improvements.

 If disabling overlays doesn’t help, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 5: Turn off VSync

 Another possible cause of the crashes is Vertical Sync. It’s a graphics feature that resolves screen tearing by locking the FPS to 60\. But there’re also reports showing that VSync could also lead to stability issues. So you need to make sure to disable VSync for Mass Effect.

Here’s how to disable VSync with NVIDIA graphics card:

1. In the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select**Manage 3D settings** . In the right pane, click**Vertical sync** and select**Off** from the drop down menu. Then click**Apply** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1.jpg)

Now you can launch Mass Effect and check if it crashes again.

 There’re also feedback saying that Mass Effect is having issues with**wireless peripherals** on Xbox. So if Mass Effect is crashing on your Xbox, before the official patches come out, you can use these steps to work around the crash.

1. First you need to make sure your wireless headset is turned off.
2. Launch**Mass Effect** from your dashboard.
