**Recommended System Requirements**

 If your computer does not meet the requirements listed on the game’s system requirements, you should upgrade your computer to the specifications mentioned therein. While in order to gain the best possible gaming experience, make sure that your computer meets the recommended requirements for the game. Also, you need to update your Windows 10 to at least the 1909 version.

 1)**Check your Windows version** .

 You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard type**winver** . Then press**Enter** . Now you can see your Windows version.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![check Windows version](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/my-windows-version.png)

 Mine is 1903, which doesn’t meet the recommended requirements. So I should have my Windows updated.

 2)**Check for Windows Updates** .

 In the bottom-left corner of your Windows desktop screen, click Start![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Start-icon.jpg) \> Settings![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/settings-icon.png) . Then in the Windows Updates section, if you see there are**Updates available** , click**Download** and you should restart your computer to make it take effect.

![check for Windows Update](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-updates-available-1200x718.png)

 If you’ve checked that your system perfectly meets these requirements but just can’t really run the game smoothly, don’t worry. You can try the fixes listed below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the crash is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. And if the GPU takes longer to render a frame than expected, stuttering can occur. Manufacturers often release driver updates in response to compatibility issues with new games, so it’s important to download and install them when they’re available.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) release updates for their drivers regularly. All you need to do is go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer. Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers. For Nvidia users, you can also use GeForce Experience to check for the driver.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Install the latest Microsoft Visual C++

 To work properly, most newer games need the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++. And there is a possibility that some of your Visual C++ Redistributables files are missing and that causes the crashing issue. So you should[download](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and install the latest ones, both ×86 and ×64.

---

## Fix 4: Run Steam as an administrator

 Granting Steam with administrator rights can solve many issues including the crashing issue. So you should run Steam as an administrator.

 1) Right-click on the Steam shortcut from your desktop and select**Open file location** .

## Fix 5: Allow your game through controlled folder access

 Sometimes Windows Security may block your game from running. So you should manually add your game to the list of allowed apps to prevent it from being blocked.

To do so, you can:

 1) In the**Search** box, type**windows security** and click**Windows Security** from the results.

![allow  an app through controlled folder access Serious Sam 4 ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/manage-ransomware-protection-1200x684.png)

 3) Switch the**Controlled folder access** setting to**On** . When a window pops up asking “**Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device** “, click**Yes** .  
 Then click**Allow an app through Controlled folder access** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/allow-an-app-through-controlled-folder-access-2-1-1200x684.png)

 5) Then navigate to the game’s installation folder and select**Sam4.exe** .

## Fix 6: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs like your game crashing and stuttering on PC. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Launch the Steam client.

2) Under the **LIBRARY**  tab, right-click on **Serious Sam 4** and select **Properties** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is steam-select-propertite.jpg](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/steam-select-propertite.jpg)

 3) Click on the **LOCAL FILES**  tab and click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

![verify game files serious sam 4 crash or shutter](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify-integrity-of-game-files-1.png)

 This verification process would take a while to finish. After that, play your game to check if the issue is solved.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**taskmgr** and press**Enter** .

## Fix 12: Disable overclocking

 If you have any overclocking applications like**RivaTuner** or**MSI Afterburner** running on your computer, disable them. They would cause crashes for many games including Serious Sam 4.

---

 So these are fixes for Serious Sam 4 crashing or stuttering issues. Hopefully, they work for you. To have the best possible gaming experience, you should always check if there’s an update available.
