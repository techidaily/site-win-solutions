### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the Wolcen launching issue.

 To do this, you can visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer, (such as **[ AMD](<https://www.amd.com/en/support>**
**Nvidia)**  ,[**Nvidia**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  , etc.) and download the driver manually.

 But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)
