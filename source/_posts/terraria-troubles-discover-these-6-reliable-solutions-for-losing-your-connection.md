1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Terraria** and click**Properties** .

![verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2\. Check if you’re playing different styles

 This error**Terraria Lost Connection** will occur if you don’t have a character to coordinate with the type of map.

 If you have a Classic Map or try to join someone’s Classic Mode game, you should have a Classic Character. Likewise, if you have a Journey Map / want to join a Journey Mode game, you should have a Journey Character.

 Make sure to create a character accordingly before and you won’t be seeing the**Connection Lost** error in Terraria.

### Fix 3\. Deactivate Windows Firewall

 Make sure your Windows Firewall (as well as your antivirus software) is not blocking the connection. To do that, you will need to turn off Windows Firewall and uninstall your antivirus software temporarily. Here’s how:

 If you don’t feel so sure about turning off your Firewall, you can add Terraria to its exception list. Type**Allow an app through Windows Firewall** in the Search box and follow the on-screen instructions to continue.

1. Type**windows defender firewall** in the Search box, and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win-11-windows-defender.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .  
![turn off firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Turn-on-or-off.jpg)
3. Select **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)** for Domain network, Private Network, and Public network. Then click **OK** .  
![turn off firewall for all](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/turn-off.jpg)

 After turning off your firewall, restart Terraria to check if the**Connection Lost in Terraria** has been solved.

### Fix 4\. Update your network adapter driver

 If the network adapter driver you’re using is faulty or outdated, you will possibly encounter this ‘Lost Connection’ error in Terraria. To fix the potential problems and ensure less lagging, you should install the latest network driver on your computer.

**Manually –** To update your network adapter driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
