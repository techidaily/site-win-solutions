![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/genshin-impact-featured-image-1.jpg)

 Released on September 28, 2020, Genshin Impact is still one of the most popular role-playing games by now. However, many players complained that Genshin Impact won’t launch from time to time or the issue occurs after an update. If you run into the same issue, don’t worry. We’ve got some fixes for you.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Run Genshin Impact as an administrator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install the latest DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Perform a clean boot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Repair the game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Before you continue to the more complicated methods below,**restart your computer** to see if the problem goes away. Also make sure your machine meets the[**minimum requirements**](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5284) to play the game.

### Fix 1 – Run Genshin Impact as an administrator

 In some cases, you’ll need to run Genshin Impact as an administrator so that it can access the necessary permissions to work properly. Here’s how:

1. Go to the game’s installation folder. Right-click the**GenshinImpact.exe file** and select**Properties** .

2. Choose the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick**Disable fullscreen optimizations** and**Run the program as an administrator** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/run-genshin-as-administrator-1.jpg)

 After you apply the settings, launch the Genshin Impact file directly from the folder and see if it opens correctly. If not, check out the second fix below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of Genshin Impact not launching is a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. GPU manufacturers will keep releasing driver updates along with new game patches. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a while, definitely do it now to see if that fixes your issue.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

#### **Option 1 – Download the install the driver manually**

 You can visit the official websites of the graphics cards manufacturers ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), find the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and then download it manually. This process will require some computer skills and patience.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

### Fix 3 – Install the latest DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable files

 Now that you’ve installed the latest DirectX and Visual redistributable files, see if Genshin Impact works. If not, proceed to the next method.

 After the computer starts up, launch Genshin Impact to check if the issue persists. If it works without trouble,**enable the services one or a few like four or five at a time** . If the game works fine, there is no problem with these services. Then repeat the steps until you’ve checked all the services.

 If the services are not the culprits, **open Task Manager to enable the startup items (4 or 5 in a group)** to rule out the problematic applications. Some players reported that the Faceit app might interfere with Genshin Impact.

 If you find any services or applications that stop the game from launching, simply disable them before you play the game.

**IMPORTANT** : Once you’ve completed the troubleshooting process, you have to reset your computer to start normally. Follow the instruction below.

1. Type**system configuration** in the Windows search box and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-4.jpg)
2. Under the General tab, tick**Normal startup** and click**OK** .

### Fix 5 – Repair the game files

1. Open the Genshin Impact launcher.
2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.
