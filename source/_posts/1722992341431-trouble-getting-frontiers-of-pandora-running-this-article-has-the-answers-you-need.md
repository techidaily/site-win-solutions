 As you can also see from the table, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora could have rather high requirements for your computer like Valhalla, when compared to other games.

If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for it to run.

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information:[**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

 When you’re sure that your machine meets the system requirements to run the game, but Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora still refuses to launch, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 3\. Disable conflicting software

 Sometimes, Ubisoft can be a bit sensitive about certain programs running in the background. Here’s a list of software that could most likely interrupt the proper launching of Ubisoft and its services:

* MSI Afterburner
* Anti-virus or anti-spyware software
* VPN, proxy, or other firewall and security software
* P2P or file-sharing software
* IP filtering or blocking software
* Download manager programs

## 4\. Update device drivers

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora not launching problem, so if the above methods don’t help Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora to launch, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

## 5\. Verify game files on Ubisoft

 Corrupted or missing files will stop your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora from running or launching as well. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on Ubisoft in this way:

1. Open Ubisoft Connect, and find Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora under the**Games** tab.
2. Select**Properties** , then**Verify files** under Local files.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-30.png)
3. If prompted, select**Repair** . Ubisoft Connect will then download and restore any missing or corrupted files.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-32.png)

 When the verification is done, try to launch Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again to see if it launches well now. If not, please move on to the next fix.

## 6\. Add Avatar to your antivirus exception list

 The reason why your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora refuses to launch may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Ubisoft.

 Since Ubisoft consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when running, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and the former may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Ubisoft as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you aren’t sure how to do it.

## 7\. Repair damaged or corrupt system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could help fix performance issues like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora refusing to launch. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause crashes, freezes, and problems that affect gaming performance, or even its launch.

 Repairing the core Windows system files may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to games’ not launching problems. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 Fortect comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee. If you’re not satisfied with Fortect, you can contact <support@fortect.com> for a full refund.

 (Tips: Still unsure if Fortect is what you need? Check this [Fortec Review](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ! )

 Please note that system file repair alone might not help to fix the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora not launching problem. It’s one troubleshooting step to try, and its refusal to launch can also be caused by factors we mentioned above, like outdated graphics drivers, outdated Windows, game file problems, etc. Still, a clean Windows system free of file errors is a good foundation for stable gaming.
