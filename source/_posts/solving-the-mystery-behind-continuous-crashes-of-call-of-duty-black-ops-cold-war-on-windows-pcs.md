## Fix 4: Disable Steam Overlay

 The Steam Overylay feature is convinient. However, according to the feedback from some gamers, the Steam Overlay may interfere with R-Type Final 2.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 Restart R-Type Final 2 to see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 By overclocking the CPU or turbo-boosting the graphics card, players would gain a better FPS. However, it increase the chance of game crashing issues.

 Run the game to see if it crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix still didn’t work, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Add the game as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 3rd party antivirus software may block the game files, which would lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch R-Type Final 2 and see if it crashes after you added it as an exception to your antivirus software.

 If none of the fixes above works, try reinstalling the game. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
