### Fix 6 – Update your graphics driver

 Wrong or outdated graphics driver can trigger various gaming annoyance and completely ruin the playing experience. To make your games run perfectly all the time, you need to install the up-to-date graphics driver.

 You can visit the GPU manufacturers’ websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  to download the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.jpg)
