### Fix 3: Disable Steam overlay

You can disable Steam overlay with the following steps:

1. Launch Steam.
2. Click**LIBRARY** , then right-click on **Resident Evil Village** and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.jpg)
3. In the **GENERAL** section, uncheck the **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** box.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-for-Resident-Evil-Village-2.jpg)
4. Run Resident Evil Village to see if the crashing problem is fixed. If it doesn’t cut it, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Run Steam as administrator

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **epic** , then right-click on **Steam**  and click **Run as administrator** .

### Fix 5: Verify game integrity on Steam

 Steam client has a handy feature that allows you to verify the integrity of the game – if any files on your PC are found different to the ones on Steam servers, they’ll be changed or repaired.

The steps are pretty easy:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to **LIBRARY** , then right click on Resident Evil Village game title and click **Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY.png)

6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Close background apps

 Having too many apps running in the background at the same time may also cause your game to crash. These apps compete for CPU, memory and even induce instability issues. So it makes sense that while you’re playing the game, you close these resources hungry applications and services.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** , then press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the**Startup** tab, then right-click on each item and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/123.png)
3. Restart your computer.

 RE8 still crashes? Don’t worry – there’s a couple more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Disable HDR in RE 8 and Windows

 Resident Evil Village supports High-Dynamic Range (HDR), which is a technology used to enhance contrast and colors in graphics rendering and bring about more life-like images. This may be the case, but according to some players, it could be the cause of the crash.

 So, it’s recommended that you turn off HDR mode (both in RE8 and in Windows if your monitor supports HDR) to see if it helps with the situation.

**How to turn off HDR in Resident Evil Village** :

1. Open Steam.
2. Go to**Library** , then right-click on**Resident Evil Village** and select**Properties** .

 Once you have disabled HDR, run the game in the client and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to **Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Install the latest patch

 The game crash is likely to be a bug that comes along previous updates, which requires to be patched in the next release. To check if this is the case, you can install the latest patch, then run the game again to see if the crashing problem ceases.

### Fix 9: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of Resident Evil Village crashing on your PC is software conflict.

A clean boot starts Windows with the essential programs, so that you will know if a background program is interfering with the game, or the problem lies elsewhere.
