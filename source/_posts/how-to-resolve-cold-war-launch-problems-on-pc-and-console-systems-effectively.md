## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Low FPS, lagging gameplay, or poor graphics aren’t always caused by an old graphics card. Sometimes, updating your graphics driver can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game significantly run smoother. Moreover, updating your graphics can ensure that you always have the newest features. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now as it can make a big difference.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by heading to the manufacturer’s driver download page:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 As described above, updating drivers manually does require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 5\. Disable fullscreen optimizations

 Many gamers found that there are certain CPU demanding games that are particularly affected by low FPS issues when enabling fullscreen optimizations.

## 6\. Customize graphics performance preference

 1) Right-click on the empty space from your desktop and select**Display settings** .  
  
![customize graphics performance preference ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/display-settings.jpg)

 2) Scroll down and find**Graphics settings** and click on it.

![turn off background apps](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/turn-off-background-apps.jpg)

Now launch Days Gone and check it can help fix the low frame rate.

## 8\. Disable Windows 10 Game Mode

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Gaming** .
