4) Close Steam.

5) Open your DS4 Windows. Go to the**Settings** tab to check the**Hide DS4 controller** .

 If the**Hide DS4 controller** option is already checked, then uncheck and check it again.

 If re-enabling the controller fails, you can go back to the Device Manager to uninstall the**HID-compliant game controller** . Then close your DS4 Windows and disconnect your controller and connect it again. Afterward, open DS4 Windows, and you will see your controller here again.
