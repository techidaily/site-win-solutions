### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of this error is that you’re using**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If you want to fully enjoy a new AAA title, first make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 To get the latest graphics driver, you can search and download it on the manufacturer website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ), and then install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if the error code reoccurs.

 If updating the GPU driver doesn’t solve your problem, simply move on to the next solution.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft has just released the 20H2 update for Windows 10, including some regular security patches and loads of new features. We always recommend players to**keep their system up to date** , as it could help avoid lots of troubles.

And it’s fairly easy to update:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) at the same time to open the Windows Settings app. Click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . Then wait for Windows to download and install all available updates.

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the system updates, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Black Ops Cold War.

 If the updates don’t stop the crash, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 4: Disable HAGs (GeForce 10 series or later/Radeon 5600 or 5700 series)

 In the 2004 version of Windows 10, Microsoft rolled out a new feature called **Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** , which will allegedly improve applications performance. To unlock this feature, you must be using the **latest 2004 version Windows** , a   **GeForce 10 series or later/Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card** along with the **latest GPU driver** .

 But according to some veterans, HAGs is possibly the culprit that generates the 887a0005 error code. You can try to disable HAGs and see how it goes.

Here’s how:

1. In the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select **Display settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hags-1.jpg)
2. Under the **Multiple displays** section, click **Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hags-02.jpg)
3. Under the **Default settings** section, click **Change default graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hags-3.jpg)
4. Turn off**Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hags-off.jpg)

 If this method doesn’t fix your issue, simply check out the next one.

### Fix 5: Disable in-game Ray Tracing

 In some cases, this error code shows up when your GPU is overloaded. Aside from that, Black Ops Cold War is still a new title, which means there’s still room for improvement. Ray Tracing might sound fancy, but according to some gamers it can be unstable on Black Ops Cold War. So you can try disabling this feature and check if the error code disappears.

Here’s how:

1. Launch Black Ops Cold War and open**SETTINGS** .
2. Navigate to the**GRAPHICS** tab. Under the**RAY TRACING** section, disable all three options.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-disable-ray-tracing.jpg)
3. Restart the game and test the gameplay.
