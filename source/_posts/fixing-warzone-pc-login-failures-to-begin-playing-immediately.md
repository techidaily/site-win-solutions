## Mastering Roblox Starts Up – Essential Fixes to Get You Playing Again

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Snipaste_2021-06-10_18-14-03.png)

 Roblox is definitely fun, but we’ve seen many players reporting that Roblox is not working. Somehow it just won’t launch and not letting people play the games. If you’re in the same boat, no worries! We’ve got a few working fixes you can try.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

[**1: Restart your PC**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**2: Check your browser**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**3: Reset your Internet options**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**4: Check your proxy settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**5: Reinstall Roblox desktop app**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

**[Bonus: How to keep Your PC at top condition and bring a better gaming experience](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Before we jump into anything advanced,[check the Roblox server status](https://status.roblox.com/) first. If the server is down, then you’ll have to wait until it’s fixed.

## Fix 1: Restart your PC

 The first and easiest thing you should try is a restart of your PC. Many players are able to launch Roblox after they restart their computers, so it’s definitely worth trying.

If rebooting your PC doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Check your browser

 When you choose a game on Roblox’s website and click to play, there should be a pop-up window that allows you to open the Roblox app. If the pop-up window doesn’t show in your browser, or it won’t launch Roblox with your permission, then you can**try using another browser** .

 In addition,**check if your browser is up-to-date** . If not, update it then test the issue. Some players are also able to launch Roblox after they**clear the browser’s cache** , so it’s definitely worth trying.

 If your browser doesn’t seem to be the reason for Roblox not working, move on to the next fix.

## Bonus: How to keep your PC at top condition and bring a better gaming experience

 One of the easiest PC maintenance tips is to keep your drivers up-to-date. Updating your drivers regularly helps prevent many random issues you may run into.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Just note that Windows doesn’t always give you the latest version you might need, since its database isn’t updated very frequently.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your PC and your Windows version, and it will download and install the drivers correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) For example, I want to update my graphics and network adapter driver here. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged drivers to automatically download the correct version of them. Then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg) **The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.
