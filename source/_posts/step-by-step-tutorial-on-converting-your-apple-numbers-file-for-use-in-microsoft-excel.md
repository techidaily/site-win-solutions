 Whether you're sending an Apple Numbers file to a Microsoft Excel user or are on the receiving end of a Numbers workbook you need to open as [an XLSX file](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/), we'll show you three ways to convert Numbers to Excel.

 If you're a Mac user who created the workbook in Numbers, you can convert it to an Excel file type before you send it. If you're a Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS user who received a Numbers file, you can download it to the Excel format using iCloud. And if you're somewhere in between, you can always fall back on an online file converter. Let's take a look at all three methods.

##  Convert Numbers to Excel on Mac

 Converting Numbers to [Excel on Mac](https://win-able.techidaily.com/comprehensive-troubleshooting-making-your-vrchat-run-smoothly-again/) is easy and eliminates the file recipient from having to do it.

 With your file open in Numbers, go to File > Export To > Excel from the menu bar.

![Select File, Export to, Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/FileExportToExcel-NumbersToExcel.png) 

 When the Export Your Sheet window appears, you can adjust a few options before you convert the workbook.

![Export Your Sheet window](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ExportYourSheet-NumbersToExcel.png) 

**Excel Worksheets**: Choose whether you want a worksheet for each table or each sheet. If you select a sheet for each table, you can optionally include a summary worksheet in the book. This provides a link to each table in the workbook.

**Require Password to Open**: If the workbook contains sensitive data, you can [password-protect it](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premiere-pro-performance-optimization-tips-for-a-faster-workflow/) and provide your recipient with that password. Set the password, verify it, and optionally include a hint.

**Advanced Options**: You can export the sheet in either XLSX or XLS format depending on the version of Excel your recipient uses. XLS covers older versions of Excel.

 When you finish, click "Next."
