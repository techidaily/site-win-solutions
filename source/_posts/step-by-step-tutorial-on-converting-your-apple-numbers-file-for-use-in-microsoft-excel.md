 Whether you're sending an Apple Numbers file to a Microsoft Excel user or are on the receiving end of a Numbers workbook you need to open as [an XLSX file](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/), we'll show you three ways to convert Numbers to Excel.

 If you're a Mac user who created the workbook in Numbers, you can convert it to an Excel file type before you send it. If you're a Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS user who received a Numbers file, you can download it to the Excel format using iCloud. And if you're somewhere in between, you can always fall back on an online file converter. Let's take a look at all three methods.

##  Convert Numbers to Excel on Mac

 Converting Numbers to [Excel on Mac](https://win-able.techidaily.com/comprehensive-troubleshooting-making-your-vrchat-run-smoothly-again/) is easy and eliminates the file recipient from having to do it.

 With your file open in Numbers, go to File > Export To > Excel from the menu bar.

![Select File, Export to, Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/FileExportToExcel-NumbersToExcel.png) 

 When the Export Your Sheet window appears, you can adjust a few options before you convert the workbook.

**Excel Worksheets**: Choose whether you want a worksheet for each table or each sheet. If you select a sheet for each table, you can optionally include a summary worksheet in the book. This provides a link to each table in the workbook.

**Require Password to Open**: If the workbook contains sensitive data, you can [password-protect it](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premiere-pro-performance-optimization-tips-for-a-faster-workflow/) and provide your recipient with that password. Set the password, verify it, and optionally include a hint.

 When you finish, click "Next."
