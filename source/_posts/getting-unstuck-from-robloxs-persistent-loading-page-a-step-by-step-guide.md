### Solution 1: Move your game to another drive

 Origin enables players to move games to another drive easily. Coping and pasting your game files and folders doesn’t move your games completely, so you’ll need to do it via Origin.

 If Anthem shows a infinitely spinning circle when loading, you can move Anthem to another drive to fix this issue.

#### Step 1: Kill Anthem’s and Origin’s processes completely

Make sure that Anthem is closed and not running in the background.

1) Close Anthem application.

2) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

3) Type**taskmgr** and click**OK** .

 For instance, Anthem is saved in C drive, then you can move it to any other drive except for C drive.

### Solution 3: Update your drivers

 A missing or outdated device driver in your computer can cause Anthem not loading, especially your graphics card driver and your network adapter driver. To rule it out as the cause, you should verify that the device drivers are up to date, and update those that aren’t.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver: manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your device manufacturer, find the latest correct driver for your device, then download and install it into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-856.png)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged video card and network adapter to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**_Update All_** and get a 30-day money guarantee).

4) Once updated, restart your computer to take effect.

Now launch Anthem on your computer, and your game should be loading.

 That’s a no go for you? Don’t worry. There are other fixes to try.

### Solution 4: Turn off Origin In-Game Overlay

 Sometimes the in-game overlays can result in game crashing as it may cause software conflicts. To rule it out as the cause, you can turn off Origin In-Game Overlay and see it you can fix your issue.

1) Launch Origin in your computer, and log into your Origin account.

2) Click the Origin menu button and click**Application settings** .

5) Restart Origin and Anthem to see how it works.

Hopefully this will fix your Anthem not loading issue.

### Solution 5: Run Anthem as an administrator

 If Anthem keeps sticking on infinite loading screen, running it as an administrator will help.

Here’s what you need to do:

1) Open File Explorer, and go to the game folder of Anthem.

2) Right click on Anthem setup file, and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-861.png)

 If the option is**Ultra** or**High** , change it to**Medium** or**Low** . If the option is**Medium** or**Low** , change it to**Ultra** or**High** .
