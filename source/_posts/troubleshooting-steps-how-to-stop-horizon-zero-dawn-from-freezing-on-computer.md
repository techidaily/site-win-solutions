**Recommended System Requirements**

 If your computer does not meet the requirements listed on the game’s system requirements, you should upgrade your computer to the specifications mentioned therein. While in order to gain the best possible gaming experience, make sure that your computer meets the recommended requirements for the game. Also, you need to update your Windows 10 to at least the 1909 version.

 1)**Check your Windows version** .

 You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard type**winver** . Then press**Enter** . Now you can see your Windows version.

![check Windows version](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/my-windows-version.png)

 Mine is 1903, which doesn’t meet the recommended requirements. So I should have my Windows updated.

 2)**Check for Windows Updates** .

 In the bottom-left corner of your Windows desktop screen, click Start![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Start-icon.jpg) \> Settings![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/settings-icon.png) . Then in the Windows Updates section, if you see there are**Updates available** , click**Download** and you should restart your computer to make it take effect.

![check for Windows Update](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-updates-available-1200x718.png)

 If you’ve checked that your system perfectly meets these requirements but just can’t really run the game smoothly, don’t worry. You can try the fixes listed below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the crash is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. And if the GPU takes longer to render a frame than expected, stuttering can occur. Manufacturers often release driver updates in response to compatibility issues with new games, so it’s important to download and install them when they’re available.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) release updates for their drivers regularly. All you need to do is go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer. Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers. For Nvidia users, you can also use GeForce Experience to check for the driver.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 Updating drivers manually can be time-consuming and if you’re not familiar with computer hardware, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically detects, downloads, and installs the correct or missing drivers for your system.

Here’s how to update drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer for them to take effect, and then launch your game to check if the issue is fixed. If not, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Install the latest Microsoft Visual C++

 To work properly, most newer games need the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++. And there is a possibility that some of your Visual C++ Redistributables files are missing and that causes the crashing issue. So you should[download](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and install the latest ones, both ×86 and ×64.

---

## Fix 4: Run Steam as an administrator

 Granting Steam with administrator rights can solve many issues including the crashing issue. So you should run Steam as an administrator.

 1) Right-click on the Steam shortcut from your desktop and select**Open file location** .

![run Steam as an administrator to fix Serious Sam 4 crashing and suttering issue](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-Steam-as-an-administrator-right-click-from-the-desktop-and-select-open-file-location.jpg)

 2) Scroll down and find the**Steam application** . (It should be highlighted.) Right-click on it and select**Properties** .

![run Steam as an administrator to fix Serious Sam 4 crashing and suttering issue](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-Steam-as-an-administrator-select-Properties-1.jpg)

 3) Select the tab**Compatibility** and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .

![run Steam as an administrator to fix Serious Sam 4 crashing and suttering issue](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-steam-as-an-administrator-apply-ok.jpg)

If this didn’t work, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Allow your game through controlled folder access

To do so, you can:

 1) In the**Search** box, type**windows security** and click**Windows Security** from the results.

![allow  an app through controlled folder access Serious Sam 4 ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-security-1.png)

 2) Select**Virus & threat protection** from the left pane. Scroll down and under the**Ransomware protection** section, click**Manage ransomware protection** .

 3) Switch the**Controlled folder access** setting to**On** . When a window pops up asking “**Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device** “, click**Yes** .  
 Then click**Allow an app through Controlled folder access** .

![allow  an app through controlled folder access Serious Sam 4 ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/allow-an-app-through-controlled-folder-access-1200x684.png)

## Fix 6: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs like your game crashing and stuttering on PC. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Launch the Steam client.

2) Under the **LIBRARY**  tab, right-click on **Serious Sam 4** and select **Properties** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is steam-select-propertite.jpg](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/steam-select-propertite.jpg)

 3) Click on the **LOCAL FILES**  tab and click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

![verify game files serious sam 4 crash or shutter](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify-integrity-of-game-files-1.png)

 This verification process would take a while to finish. After that, play your game to check if the issue is solved.
