 Does nothing happen when you click on Play? You’re definitely not alone here. Many Far Cry 6 players are reporting the same. If Far Cry 6 won’t launch, below are some troubleshooting steps for you.

## Far Cry 6 won’t launch? Here’s why

* **You’re using Windows 11.** Ubisoft recommends using Windows 10 if possible instead.
* **Your system is not up to date.** Make sure you perform a complete Windows update.
* **The GPU driver (sometimes your audio drivers, too) is faulty, outdated.** Always keep your GPU driver updated to the latest game-ready version.
* **Conflicting apps (especially third-party antivirus software).** Restart your PC without any start-ups.
* **Overlay features.** It’s recommended to disable all overlays.
* **Lack of administrative privileges.** Run Far Cry 6 and your launcher as an administrator.
* **The game itself is buggy.** Wait for the next game patch if nothing is wrong on your end. Or **[contact Ubisoft Support](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/contact)**  for further assistance.

 Please make sure you’re running the latest version of the Windows system and avoid any kind of overclocking before heading to the fixes below.

### Fix 2\. Run your game as admin

 In case lacking administrative privileges cause your Far Cry 6 not to start, we recommend that you run the game executable file and game launcher (Ubisoft Connect / Epic Games Launcher) as an administrator.

1. Close any game-related apps. Then Right-click your Ubisoft Connect and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![run ubisoft as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/run-as-admin.jpg)
3. Click **Apply** \> **OK** .
4. Also, repeat step 1\~2 for the Far Cry.exe file.

 Try restarting the game and see if it helps with the ‘Far Cry 6 not launching’ issue. If not, don’t worry since we have a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 3\. Verify your games files

 Corrupted game files can cause your game not to launch, and it’s easily done by verifying your game files. Here’s how:

 Close Ubisoft Connect, and then go to _**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Ubisoft\\Ubisoft Game Launcher**_ and delete the **Cache** folder.

 Launch Ubisoft Connect and check if Far Cry 6 still crashes like before. If this method doesn’t work, you can **uninstall** Ubisoft Connect to further troubleshoot the problem. But remember to [make a backup](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/manually-backing-up-ubisoft-connect-pc-save-files/000063179) beforehand.

 To **install** Ubisoft Connect PC:

1. Download the latest version of [Ubisoft Connect PC](https://ubi.li/4vxt9) .
2. Run the installer you downloaded with administrator rights.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Fix 4\. Update your GPU driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated GPU driver, you will get constant game crashes while playing Far Cry 6\. This is especially the case if you’re using a 30-series graphics card.

 AMD and NVIDIA keep releasing new drivers to add more features or fix some known bugs. To make sure it works to its best in-game performance, you will always need to ensure it’s up to date.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer, and installing it step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install it manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![scan drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scan-now-5.7.0.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

![update all drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/update-all.jpg)
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.

### Fix 5\. Turn off overlays

 It’s reported by some players that turning off all overlays helps with the crashing issue. You can follow the steps below to disable them.

1. Launch Ubisoft Connect, and go to **Settings** .
2. Under the General tab, untick the **Enable in-game overlay for supported games** and **Display FPS counter in game** .  
![Enable in-game overlay for supported games](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/in-game-overlay.jpg)
3. Try Far Cry 6 again to test the issue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6\. Disable background applications

 Some Microsoft services or third-party software may interfere with your Far Cry 6\. If that’s the case, you may need to close all background programs and reboot your system.

1. Press the **Windows**  and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type in _**msconfig**_ and press **Enter** .

3. Choose **Selective startup** , and uncheck **Load startup items** .  
![Uncheck Load startup item](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/load-start-ups-no.jpg)
4. Reboot your system.

 If everything works fine without any background apps running, you might need to find the problematic one by[performing a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Some apps that are worth noticing
