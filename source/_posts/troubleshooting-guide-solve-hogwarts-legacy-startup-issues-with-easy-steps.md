 1) Press**Ctrl + Shift + Delete** to open Task Manager.

 2) Locate any process that is related to Revolve.

### Fix 2\. Unplug USB devices

 According to what many Resolve users have suggested, USB devices can cause your Resolve to not open so you can unplug these devices to check if your Resolve works again.

 Resolve will act up especially if you’re using a USB headset as the audio output device. Once you have removed the USB device from your PC, launch your Revolve again.

### Fix 3\. Launch DaVinci Resolve in Compatibility mode

 Still can’t launch your Resolve? It might be caused by some incompatibility issues, which can be solved by running Resolve in compatibility mode.

1. Right-click on the Resolve shortcut or the executable file in the installation folder, and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/resolve-properties.jpg)
2. Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check the**Run this program in compatibility for** Windows 8 or Windows 7.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/resolve-compatibibility.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

 Now you can run Resolve to test the issue. If DaVinci Resolve is still not responding, you can head on to the next fix below.

### Fix 4\. Update the graphics driver

 Editing videos with this DaVinci Resolve is very GPU-extensive, so it is mandatory to keep the GPU drivers updated (and sometimes your audio drivers, too).

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![scan drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scan-now-5.7.0.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![update all drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and launch your Resolve to check if the issue has been resolved.

### Fix 5\. Increase the Virtual Memory

 If your system is low on virtual memory, Windows increases the size of your virtual memory paging file. During this process, memory requests for some applications may be denied, e.g your DaVinci Resolve. To alleviate this, you can manually increase the size of your paging file.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key +**R** key at the same time, and enter**sysdm.cpl** to open system settings.  
![command line](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/system-run-commands.jpg)
2. Go to the**Advanced** tab and select**Settings** under**Performance** .  
![view the advanced settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/advanced.jpg)
3. Once the Performance Options window is open, go to the**Advanced** tab and select**Change** .  
![adjust virtual memory size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/property-options.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Uncheck the**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** . Then select**Custom size** , and enter the value accordingly.

**Note:** It’s recommended to use a number that’s**one and a half times** the total available memory for the “**Initial size** ” and**three times** of available memory for the “**Maximum size** ” when possible. (For example, my installed RAM is 16GB, so I set the initial size to 24,000, maximum size to 48,000). If you don’t know your installed RAM, you can press the**Windows** key +**Pause** to check your device specifications.
5. Click **OK**  to confirm the change.

 Restart your computer for the changes to take effect, and try opening your DaVinci Resolve to check if it launches successfully.

### Fix 6\. Enable IGPU Multi-Monitor in BIOS

 It’s reported by many users that the IGPU Multi-Monitor feature can affect the use of DaVinci Resolve, thus causing Resolve to not open. To enable this feature, you should restart your PC and enter BIOS.

| **Brand**             | **BIOS Key**       |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| HP                    | F9 or Esc          |
| Dell                  | F12                |
| Acer                  | F12                |
| Lenovo                | F12                |
| Asus                  | Esc                |
| Samsung               | F12                |
| Sony                  | Esc                |
| Microsoft Surface Pro | Volume Down Button |

1. Restart your computer and keep pressing the setup key (shown above) as soon as you see the manufacturer’s logo on the screen to enter the BIOS settings.
2. Under the**Advanced** Settings, you will see the**IGPU Multi-Monitor Option** .
3. Switch this feature from**Disabled** to**Enabled** .
4. Save and exit the BIOS.

### Fix 7\. Uninstall your antivirus software

 Antivirus software is known to interfere with many programs, and if you’re experiencing issues with Resolve after installing third-party antivirus software, you might need to uninstall them because disabling them is not enough to prevent them from running in the background.

 In the meantime, you should disable VPN services, such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN.

 If DaVinci Resolve won’t launch after removing your antivirus software and disabling your VPN, you can try the next fix below.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8\. Allow TCP Network Port Access

 Another reason why your DaVinci Resolve is not responding is that it lacks access to your TCP ports, which is necessary for your DaVinci Resolve to launch successfully.

Here’s how to troubleshoot this issue quickly:

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows + R key at the same time, and enter**powershell** .  
![open powershell](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Enter the following command line:  
 _**Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $\_.State -eq “Listen” -and $\_.LocalPort -eq 1144 } | ForEach-Object { (get-process -id $\_.OwningProcess).Description }**_
3. If nothing pops up in the next entry, there’s nothing wrong with your TCP network. But if it does, you might need to contact the**Blackmagic Design** support team with your log file.  
   * Navigate to**C:\\Program Files\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve** .  
   * Double click on the**CaptureLogs.bat** file (or right-click and then run as administrator).  
   * It will generate a **log file**  to your desktop –**DaVinci-Resolve-logs-<current time>.zip** .

### Fix 9\. Reinstall DaVinci Resolve

 If none of the fixes above solved your Resolve not opening issue, you can clean reinstall your program and delete all files ( **C:\\Program Files\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve** ) left behind.
