### Fix 1: Check the game’s system requirements

 Games may not launch if your device is just at or below the game’s system requirements. So you should first check the system requirements for Age of Empires IV and ensure that your device is powerful enough to run the game. The system requirements for Age of Empires IV are as follows:

#### Minimum requirements

| Processor: | Intel Core i5-6300U or AMD Ryzen 5 2400G |
| Graphics:  | Intel HD 520 or AMD Radeon RX Vega 11    |
| Memory:    | 8 GB RAM                                 |
| DirectX:   | Version 12                               |

#### Recommended

| OS:        | Windows 10/11 64-bit                                             |

 After confirming that your PC is good enough to run the game, go ahead with the following fixes.

## Fix 2: Verify the integrity of game files

 The game not launching issue can be caused by corruption in your extracted game files. To see if that’s the case, you can scan and repair game files through Steam. Here’s how:

1. Run Steam and click**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click**Age of Empires IV** and select**Properties…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AOE4-steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.

Once the process is completed, try launching the game again.

If the issue persists, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The game not launching issue could indicate that you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix the potential problem, you should make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-nvidia-gtx-1080.jpg)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if you can launch Age of Empires IV now.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 If you’re not running DirectX 12 on your device, you’re likely to encounter the Age of Empires IV not launching issue. To fix it, you need to install all pending Windows updates. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the**Windows Settings** . Then select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/updates-security.jpg)
2. Under Windows Update, click**Check for updates** . Then Windows will automatically download and install the available updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Windows update check for updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Windows-update-check-for-updates.png)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and try to launch the game.

If the problem remains, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 5: Update Visual C++ Redistributables

 Visual C++ Redistributables are software packages required by many applications to function properly. If there are any missing or corrupted redistributables files, your game may not launch. So make sure you have all the necessary files to run Age of Empires IV. You can find the latest visual studio files[here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) .

* If you are using a 64-bit Operating System, download the[vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc%5Fredist.x64.exe) file.
* If you are using a 32-bit Operating System, download the[vc_redist.x86.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc%5Fredist.x86.exe) file.

 Please Note that Age of Empires IV requires Win10 64-bit as part of its minimum technical requirements, if you are running a 32-bit version, you may not be meeting min-spec.

 Once you’ve downloaded the Redistributables, follow the on-screen instruction to install them and then restart your computer.

Check if you can launch the game without any problem.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, proceed to the next one.

### Fix 6: Check your security software

 Your security software may prevent the game from launching. To make sure Age of Empires IV is not being blocked by your security software, you can add the game to the allow-list of**Windows Defender** ,**Windows Security** ,**Windows Controlled Folder Access** and**your antivirus program** . Here’s how:

#### Windows Defender

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**firewall.cpl** and click**OK** .

4. Select**RelicCardinal.exe** .

#### Other antivirus programs

 The way to whitelist the game in your antivirus will vary depending on the antivirus software you are using. You can refer to your antivirus software’s support website.

 If the game is on the allow-list for your antivirus programs, check to see if temporarily disabling the program allows the game to launch.

If it doesn’t, try the last fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 The Age of Empires IV may not launch if you’re running software that interferes with Steam and your game. To see if that’s the case, you can perform a clean boot. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type **msconfig** and click **OK** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/msconfig.jpg)
2. In System Configuration, navigate to the **Services** tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)

<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-disable-programs.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

 Try launching the game again. If the game launches normally, you can try to enable services one by one until you find the problematic software.

Restart your PC to apply the changes after enabling each service.

 Once you find out the problematic program that prevents the game from launching, you may need to uninstall it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.
