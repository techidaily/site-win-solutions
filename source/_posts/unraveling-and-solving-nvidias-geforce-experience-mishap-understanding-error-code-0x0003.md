![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tiny-tinas-wonderlands.jpg)

 Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands is an exciting Borderland game of this year. While many players are enjoying the fun and engaging gameplay, there are quite a lot of complaints about the game crashes. If youâ€™re also experiencing Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands crashing on your Windows PC, donâ€™t worry. Weâ€™ve got some simple fixes for you.

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 methods for you to fix the Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands crashes. You donâ€™t have to try them all. Just work from the top down until you find the one that solves your problem.

1. **[Disable peripherals](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Run the game on DX11](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Verify integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Stop overclocking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 â€“ Disable peripherals

 According to some players, Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands crashes when they have a controller connected. While peripherals can add more fun to games, they might trigger compatibility issues with new titles. So if youâ€™re using any peripherals like   **a wheel, controller, other USB devices or even the second monitor** , simply unplug them and see how thing goes. If the problem persists, check out more solutions below.

### Fix 2 â€“ Run the game on DX11

 The game launches in DX12 by default. But if you receive a specific error saying DX12 is not supported, you should force the DX11 mode. This may eliminate the crashes and make your game more stable at a lower performance.

1. Launch Epic Games launcher and navigate to the**Settings** tab.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and expand Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands under Manage Games.
3. Check**Additional Command Line Arguments** and enter**\-dx11** in the field.

 Now see if you can play the game smoothly. If not, move forward to the next fix below.

### Fix 3 â€“ Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphics driver is one of the most common causes of game crashes. Although Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands doesnâ€™t require demanding hardware, you still need to make sure your device drivers, especially the GPU driver, are already up-to-date for the best game performance.

 Major GPU manufacturers constantly roll out new drivers to provide performance improvements. You can visit their websites, **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , to download the latest graphics driver and install them manually.

 If youâ€™re not ready to pay, you can click the**Update** button next to the flagged GPU driver to download the correct version of that driver, then youâ€™ll need to install it manually.

### Fix 5 â€“ Stop overclocking

 Overclocking your CPU and GPU can give you a significant performance boost, but it can possibly lead to instability issues like a game crash. To rule out this cause, you should just**turn off all the overclocking utilities** and**reset your processor to the default** . If doing this alone doesnâ€™t stop the crashes, try deleting certain game files. This is an effective workaround for Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands not launching or crashing at startup. Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command.
2. Type**%localappdata%\\Tiny Tinaâ€™s Wonderlands\\Saved** and click**OK** .
