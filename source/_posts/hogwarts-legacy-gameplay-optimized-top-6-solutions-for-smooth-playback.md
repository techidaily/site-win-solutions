Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.
