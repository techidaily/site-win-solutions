 Before you try out the following solutions, make sure you’ve tried to restart your PC and Roblox to see if your problem is just a one-time random error.

## Fix 1: Turn up the volume for Roblox

 Sometimes your PC is unmuted but the volume of a certain app is turned down. You can check the audio for Roblox to see if it’s enabled and adjust the volume:

1. Right-click the**little speaker icon** on the far right side of your taskbar, then click**Open Volume mixer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-26_16-20-43.jpg)
2. Scroll to find Roblox. Make sure**the audio is unmuted** and you can**bring up the volume** to 100 by default.

 If you’ve turned up the volume for Roblox but the audio is still missing, or Roblox doesn’t show up in your Volume mixer, try the next solution.

## Fix 2: Check Roblox settings

 The next thing you can do is to check if the sound is enabled in your Roblox game. Roblox allows players to adjust settings for individual games. You can follow the steps below:

1. Launch Roblox, play the game that you find audio missing.
2. Click the**Roblox logo icon** at the top-left corner of your Roblox window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-27_14-34-14.jpg)
3. Switch to the**Settings** tab. Make sure your audio is not muted and the**Volume** is not too low.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-27_14-35-15.jpg)

 If you have turned up the in-game volume but still hear no sound, try the next solution.

## Fix 3: Set your output device

 Sometimes you don’t hear the sound because it’s playing through other output devices instead of your computer speaker. Here’s how to switch audio output devices

1. Right-click the**little speaker icon** on the far right side of your taskbar, then click**Open Sound Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/win11-sound-settings.png)
2. Under**Output** , make sure you choose your speaker or the device you wish to use. You can double-check by clicking**App volume and device preferences** and setting the output device and volume for Roblox.

 Sometimes the devices connected to your PC could interfere with normal audio output. If you’ve adjusted the above settings but your computer speaker still doesn’t work, make sure to unplug/disconnect devices such as your headset or external speaker from your PC.

If the problem persists, move on to the next solution.

## Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 An outdated or faulty audio driver could be responsible for the Roblox no sound issue. In our case, you may want to update your audio driver, to make sure it’s functioning properly.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your audio device: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can manually update your audio driver via the Device Manager. Or you can go to your device manufacturer’s support page to find the driver that is compatible with your operating system. Then download and install the correct driver by following the on-screen instructions.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact audio card, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-27_12-24-02.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-27_12-23-23.jpg)

 If configuring the audio channel on your PC doesn’t bring the sound back in Roblox, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Run the Windows audio troubleshooter

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**control panel** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-26_17-53-31.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-26_18-29-12.jpg)

If the problem persists, try the last fix.

## Fix 7: Reinstall Roblox

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**control panel** , then click OK.
