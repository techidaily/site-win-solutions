### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver matters a lot to your gaming performance. A corrupted or outdated graphics driver can trigger various issues like game freezing and crashing. If you don’t remember the last time you checked for driver updates, definitely do it now as it might fix the Black Desert Online crash right away.

 There are two ways you can update the graphics driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to tackle the compatibility issues with new game patches and improve the display performance. To get the correct graphics driver, you need to visit their websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then, find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit). Then, download it and install it step by step.

#### Option 2 – Update the graphics driver automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/de-1-4.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

### **Fix 5 – Delete the xcorona file**

**1)** Navigate to **Black Desert Online installation folder > bin64 > xc > na > 1** , and delete the**xcorona.xem** file.

**2)** Go to the **Black Desert Online installation folder > bin64 > xc > na > 2** , and delete the**xcorona.xem** file.
