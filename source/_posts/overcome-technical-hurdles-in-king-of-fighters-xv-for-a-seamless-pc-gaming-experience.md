### Step 2: Update your drivers

 Make sure your drivers are updated. You might think you’ve updated your graphic driver, but that’s not enough. **Many drivers are used while gaming and most of them won’t be updated regularly with your Windows Update.** The outdated or corrupted driver could be the culprit for crashing or black screen issues.

 You can update drivers one by one through the manufacturer’s official website manually, or update all drivers by[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with 2 clicks.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
