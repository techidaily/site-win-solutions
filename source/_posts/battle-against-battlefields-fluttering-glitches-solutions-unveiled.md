 Is the game working normally now? Or is it still unplayable? If the latter, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The Battlefield 5 not launching issue may occur if you’re using a faulty graphics driver or it’s out-of-date. We’d recommend you check for the driver update regularly, which can not only prevent gaming problems but also help you enjoy a smooth playful experience.

To update your graphics driver, here are two safe ways for you:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-1-7.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Test the game’s performance after your graphics driver is updated. If Battlefield 5 still fails to open, move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Turn off Origin in-game overlay

 Origin enables the in-game overlay feature by default, but that may cause Battlefield 5 not starting properly. Try disabling this option to see if the problem is fixed.

1. Launch your Origin desktop client.
2. Click**Origin** on the top pane and click**Application Settings** .

3. Navigate to the**Origin In-Game** tab, and toggle off**Enable Origin In-Game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-2-3.jpg)

 Relaunch the game to test this method. If it doesn’t help, continue to the next one below.

### Fix 5 – Disable cloud storage

 If your save file is corrupted, Battlefield 5 won’t launch neither. And a simple workaround towards this is to disable the cloud storage in Origin.

1. Open the Origin client.
2. Click**Origin** \>**Applications Settings** .

4. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to invoke File Explorer. Then, select**Document** from the left pane.
5. Rename your**Battlefield V** folder to Battlefield V backup or anything else.

 Check whether you can get into Battlefield 5 or not. If this method is of no avail, restore the folder’s name and try the last fix.

### Fix 6 – Perform a reinstallation

 A fresh reinstallation is a common but solid fix to constant program problems. So, if all else above can’t get your Battlefield V back to life, try to reinstall the game completely.

1. Run the Origin client.
2. Select**My Game Library** on the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-1.jpg)
3. Right-click the**Battlefield 5** tile from the list, and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-2.jpg)

 After the process finishes, you can reinstall the game from Origin again, and it should be working the right way as expected.
