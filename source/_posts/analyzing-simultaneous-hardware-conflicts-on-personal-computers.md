## Mastering the Game: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Running Perfectly on Personal Computers Now

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, an action-adventure game, was released on November 15, 2019\. I bet most players (not to mention the Star Wars fans) would enjoy the experience of waving a lightsaber and slaughtering enemies, despite a few game issues that might put a damper on it. One of the most commonly-seen problem is crashing – whether on startup or in the middle of the game – and it’s also the most annoying one. So what can you possibly do to fix this issue? Read on and find the answers.

### Fix 1: Update your graphics drivers

 Your crashing issue in Star Wars Jedi may be caused by outdated or corrupt graphics card drivers (aka video drivers). To check if that’s the root cause, you should try updating your video drivers to a relatively new and stable version first.

 Usually, you can get the latest driver from your video card’s manufacturer (such as [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) , [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ) and then install it by yourself. However, you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-439.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged driver (say your graphics card driver) to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 2: Run the game as an administrator

 This quick fix is more like a general solution for all the games that cannot be launched properly, and it’s very easy to apply. As long as you have the administrative privileges to run the game, you should give this fix a try.

 1) Locate the **executable file** of Star Wars Jedi in your PC. Right-click on it and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-24.png)

 2) In the **Properties** window, on the **Compatibility** tab, select **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-26.png)

 Now you should be able to run the game under administrative privileges permanently. If you want to revert this configuration, simply uncheck **Run this program as an administrator** .

If you continue to have the crashing problem, please proceed to Fix 3.

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 Chances are the crashing issue has been triggered by a corrupted game file. If that’s indeed the cause, you should attempt to verify the integrity of all the game files, using the built-in tool of Steam, Origin, or Epic Games Launcher.

* **[I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Origin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Steam

 1) Log in Steam and click **LIBRARY** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-23.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-23.png)

 2) Right-click **Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order** and select **Properties** .

 3) Go to the **LOCAL FILES** tab and select **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1025.png)

 4) Wait for the process to complete. When finished, exit Steam and then reopen it. Run Star Wars Jedi and see if it keeps crashing.

#### I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Origin

1) Run Origin.

2) Click **My Game Library** , right-click **Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order** and select **Repair** .

3) Wait for the process to complete. After that, relaunch the game and see if it has gone back to normal.

#### I’m playing Star Wars Jedi on Epic Games Launcher

1) Run Epic Games Launcher.

2) Click**Library** in the left pane, then click the**cog icon** under Star Wars Jedi.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-65.png)

 3) In the drop-down menu, click**Verify** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-67.png)

 4) After the verification is finished, relaunch Star Wars Jedi and see if your problem goes away.

 If verifying the integrity of game files didn’t resolve your issue, you should take a stab at Fix 4.

### Fix 4: Close unnecessary programs

 If there’s a program in your PC that conflicts with Star Wars Jedi, you’ll probably fail to run the game. Although this kind of software clashes don’t occur very often, it’s still worth trying to close unnecessary programs.

To completely shut down a program:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then click **Task Manager** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is img_5a0d6aed19abc.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a0d6aed19abc.png)

 2) In the **Task Manager**  window, on the **Processes** tab, select the program you want to shut down and click **End task** . (If it’s a program you’re using, e.g. Microsoft Word, make sure you save any unsaved work first.)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-243.png)

**Exercise caution when you try to end these processes** . If you mistakenly close one of the important system programs, that might cause your computer to stop running properly.

**Note** that your trouble is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if Star Wars Jedi can run normally. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 Also, remember to check carefully in the blacklists (or quarantine) of your third-party antivirus program and Windows Firewall for any files related to Star Wars Jedi. Once you spot them, manually add the files as exceptions to the antivirus.

 If the game works properly after you disable the antivirus, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or simply install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 If, after disabling all the unnecessary programs your Star Wars Jedi is still crashing, you should try Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 To anyone in pursuit of ultimate gaming experience, it’s quite common to speed up the CPU/GPU a notch or two. Usually, it won’t cause you much trouble; just don’t push them too hard – otherwise, the overclocking may undermine the stability of your PC, raising the risks of game crashes and even hardware malfunction (such as overheat).

 If you’re now overclocking your computer, try to stop it for a while and see whether that resolves your crashing problem in Star Wars Jedi. If possible, underclock your GPU a bit and then turn down/off some of the in-game graphics settings. That will release some burden from your hardware and enable the game to run more fluidly, but it’s not essential.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Wait for more updates

 This method may seem rather passive, but if the root cause doesn’t really lie in your gaming machine, then you should probably just wait for some new updates to get the problem fixed. Of course, if you’d like to do something else, you can also forward your problem to the developer ( **[Contact EA](https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/)**  ) or look for other solutions on related forums.
