System requirements for Snap Camera

 If the hardware meets the minimum requirements, but you haven’t updated the driver for your specific graphics card or your webcam, then you should give it a try.

There are two ways for you to update your graphics and webcam drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1: Manually

 To update your webcam driver, you’ll need o go to your graphics or webcam manufacturer’s website and download the exact driver for your operating system, then manually install it step by step.

### Option 2: Automatically

 For some people, the process of updating graphics and webcam drivers can be really time-consuming and error-prone. If that’s the case with you, we highly recommend you to update with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your Xbox adapter driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

Or if you just want to update your webcam driver for free, simply click the**Update** button next to it (it’s partly manual).

## Fix 5: Turn off VPN services

 Using a VPN can also lead to a temporary network block. So be sure to disable it and log into Snap Camera again.

## Fix 6: Clean reinstall Snap Camera

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** key to open the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** in the box and press**Enter** .
