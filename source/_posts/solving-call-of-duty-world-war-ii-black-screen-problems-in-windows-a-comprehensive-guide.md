 As a AAA title in 2019, Modern Warfare is challenging, both to your game skills and computer hardware. So if you’re sticking with a PC built five years ago, chances are you won’t find this “slow-motion” game enjoyable. If you notice your FPS is dropping constantly, and even worse during a shoot-out, the first thing you should do is to**check your specs and see if they meet the game requirements** . Because if they don’t, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

3. Join a game and see if your FPS gets better.

 If changing Display Mode doesn’t give you any luck, you can check out the next solution.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 When you’re experiencing FPS drops during gameplay, nine times out of ten you’re using a**faulty or outdated graphics driver** . That’s also why we recommend gamers to always keep their graphics driver up to date. Driver updates come with not only bug fixes but improvements of compatibility with new titles.

 You can update your GPU driver manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the graphics driver step by step. But if you don’t like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do these automatically. It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 If updating the driver doesn’t do the trick for you, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Check for Windows updates

### Fix 5:**Clean up resource-hungry processes**

 Sometimes your game becomes laggy when you have some background tasks eating up your RAM or CPU resources. Before opening a game in Modern Warfare, first make sure you’ve exited programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** ,**Skype** or**Windows Update** that might exhaust your computer resources.
