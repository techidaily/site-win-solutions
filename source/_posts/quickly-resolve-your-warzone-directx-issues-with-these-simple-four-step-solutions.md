 If you want to solve the flickering in Warzone, you’ve come to the right place. This post has gathered all working fixes for you.

 Before trying any complicated fixes, you might want to give**Alt+ Tab** a try. This simple shortcut has helped some players fix the flickering issue.  
**How** : Press Alt + Tab and wait for the screen to load windows. Then go back to the game.

 If it’s not working, try the fixes below. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

## Try these fixes

* [Fix 1: Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Fix 2: Change mini map shape](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Fix 3: Reinstall shaders & clear cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Fix 4: Change NVIDIA settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Fix 5: Install the old driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Update your drivers

 Make sure all of your drivers are updated. You might think you’ve updated your graphic driver, but that’s not enough. **Many drivers are used while gaming and most of them won’t be updated regularly with your Windows Update.** The outdated or corrupted driver could be the culprit for crashing, lagging, or flickering issues.

 You can update drivers one by one through the manufacturer’s official website manually, or update all drivers by[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with 2 clicks.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update audio driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
