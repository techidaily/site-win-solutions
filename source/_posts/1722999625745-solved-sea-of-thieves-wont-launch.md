### Fix 6: Disable incompatible apps

 Third-party applications might be the reason won’t launch issue. You can try to disable apps like AfterBurner that show FPS, OSD, MSI, EVGA, etc and then restart your PC. If this doesn’t help, you can also try to disable your antivirus software like Trend Micro which has been known to cause conflicts.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 7: Reinstall your game

 If the above fixes don’t work, reinstall your game may be the only choice. The clean uninstall can delete every file, then redownload and install it from Microsoft store. This can make sure there’s no corruption or wrongly installed files which should make the game work again.
