### Fix 2: Update your driver

 Many PC issues are related to your drivers. Updating your drivers would improve your PC performance and avoid any potential issues. Some gamers have fixed the God of War memory leak issue after updating drivers.

There are mainly two ways you can update the driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for graphics) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 6: Save and restart regularly

 If none of the fixes would help and the memory leak is there, this might be the workaround that would help.

 Save as often as you can just restart the game once in a while. Shutting down any other unnecessary programs in the background before launching the game also helps.

 If you’re not satisfied with God of War, you can send a ticket to their[support team](https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us) .

 Yes, the God of War memory leak issue is definitely a bummer. Hope this post would help you fix your issue. If you have any working fixes or would like to share your ideas, you’re welcome to leave a comment.
