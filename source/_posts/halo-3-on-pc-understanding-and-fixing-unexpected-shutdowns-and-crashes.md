## Fix 1: Stop apps from running in the background

 Generally, the game crashes because it’s running out of memory or overheating. So to save data usage and system resources, you can stop some apps from running in the background by following these steps:

 1) On the left end of the taskbar, click the**Start** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Start-icon.jpg) icon and then click**Settings** .  
  
![open settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/start-settings.jpg)

 2) Click**Privacy** .  
  
![privacy in settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/privacy.jpg)
  

 3) Scroll down and under the**App permissions** section, click**Background apps** .  
  
![Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/background-apps.jpg)

 4) You can stop all the apps from running in the background with just one click by switching**Let apps run in the background** to**Off** . But before you do this, make sure you’ve saved the files you’re currently editing.

## Fix 2: Temporarily disable antivirus software

 There will be conflicts between antivirus scans and your enjoying your games. To avoid this, you’re supposed to try temporarily disabling your antivirus software.

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how to update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

---

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Halo 3 is available on PC through Steam. But players have been experiencing sudden crashes in Halo 3 on Steam. It can be caused by a bad game cache, so you need to ensure that the integrity of game files is intact.  
  
 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.  
  
![verify integrity of game files on Steam; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
  

 3) Right-click**Halo 3** and select**Properties** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
  

 4) Under the**LOCAL FILES** tab, click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE…** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/integrity-of-cache.png)
  

 Files verification may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, the window will automatically exit. Till then, relaunch your game.  
  
 If the issues haven’t been resolved after you tried all the methods, you can consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
