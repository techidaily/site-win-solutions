**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Open the NVIDIA control panel and change the resolution from 4k to 1440p. Click**Apply > Yes** to save the change.
