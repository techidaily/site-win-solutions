 If you’re looking for the Logitech G403 driver, you’ve come to the right place. After reading this, you’ll know exactly how to download and update the driver.

There are two ways you can do this:

#### **Option 1 – Download and install your driver manually**

 To manually get the latest driver for your Logitech G403 mouse, you can go to the **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the right driver for your device model and version of Windows, then manually download and install it.

#### Option 2 – Automatically install the Logitech G403 driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to install or update your mouse driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . All it takes is a couple of clicks.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the Logitech G403 driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Why do I need the Logitech G403 driver?

 The Logitech G403 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the mouse you use. Your mouse won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. So, we always recommend you keep your Logitech G403 driver updated for security and stability.
