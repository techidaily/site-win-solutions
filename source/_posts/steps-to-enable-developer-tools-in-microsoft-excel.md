##  Enable Excel's Developer Tab

 To unhide the Developer tab in Excel, first, open Microsoft Excel on your Windows or Mac computer.

 If you are on Excel's screen where it shows your templates, then from the left sidebar, select "Options." If you are on Excel's editing screen, then select File > More > Options instead.

 You will see an "Excel Options" window. In the left sidebar of this window, click "Customize Ribbon."
