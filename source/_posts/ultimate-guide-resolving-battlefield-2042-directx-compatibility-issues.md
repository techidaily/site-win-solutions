Battlefield 2042 is one of the most awaited games. Now players can dive into the thrilling gameplay.

## 1\. Enable game mode

 Now launch Battlefield 2042\. If your game still stutters a lot or it’s showing pretty low FPS, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When you encounter performance issues with your game, it’s high time you consider if you’re using an outdated graphics driver. Outdated drivers can introduce compatibility issues.

 Another reason you should check for driver updates is that famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. So this is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 4\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

 If you have the latest Windows version, a Geforce 10 series or later/ Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card with the latest driver, you can try to enable**hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** , a feature that is designed to provide users with a performance boost. To enable this feature, follow the instructions below.

1. Right-click on the empty space from your desktop and select **Display settings** .  

![enable hardware-acceleration GPU scheduling](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/display-settings-1.png)
2. Scroll down. Find **Graphics settings** and click on it.

5. Then navigate to your game’s installation directory. Click**BF2042.exe** and click**Add** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-BF2042.png)
6. Your game should appear on the list. Click on the**Options** button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/options-button.png)
7. Select**High Performance** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/high-performance.png)

 Tips: If you’re not sure how to locate your game’s installation folder, head to Steam. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Manage > Browse local files** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/browse-local-file.png)

 After this, restart your computer to make sure it’s applied. Then test your gameplay. If disabling hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling doesn’t make any difference, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Delete the cache for the game

 Some players reported on Reddit that deleting the game cache helped them reduce the in-game stutters. So you can give it a try and see how it works.

1. Head to**C/Users/username/Documents/Battlefield 2042** or directly go to the**Document** folder on your PC.
2. Open the**Cache** folder. Press**Ctrl + A** keys simultaneously to select all the files. Then right-click and select Delete to delete all the files.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/delete-cache.png)

If this doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 6\. Tweak in-game settings

 For some reason, settings by default may not always give you the best result. To make sure you can enjoy Battlefield 2042 to the fullest on your own computer, adjust the following in-game settings:

* Future frame rendering:**OFF**
* Vertical sync:**OFF**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/disable-vertical-sync-and-future-frame-rendering.png)
