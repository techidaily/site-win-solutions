## How To Address & Solve Discord's Packet Disruption Issues - Fixed Solution

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/discord-packet-loss.png)

 It’s annoying when you encounter high outbound packet loss in Discord – you might start lagging to everyone in the call, stuttering during streams, and getting a horrendous amount of lag while gaming.

 If you’re experiencing packet loss when running Discord, don’t panic. Here’re 6 fixes to try. You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

## Fixes to try

* [1. Restart your devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [2. Use a wired connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3. Configure Discord settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [4. Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [5. Try the web version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [6. Reinstall Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [7. Update your network adapter driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### 1\. Restart your devices

 Yes, a restart of your devices – as simple as it sounds. This almost always works when it comes to computer glitches or bugs. If your computer and router have been running for a while, now is the time to restart them.

### 2\. Use a wired connection

 Packets are more likely to get lost during transmission when you’re using a wireless network. So you may want to switch to an Ethernet connection (if it’s available), as a wired connection tends to be more stable than a wireless one.

 If you’re already using a wired connection, you may want to switch to a different network to see if that helps. For example, you can connect to your Wi-Fi, or use your phone as a hotspot and see if Discord runs correctly on them without packet loss. If yes, that could be an issue with your network. In this case, it might be worth checking with your ISP to see if they are having issues on their end.

### 3\. Configure Discord settings

Discord also offers you an option to circumvent the packet loss issue.

1) Launch Discord.

2) Go to**Settings > Voice & Video > Advanced** .

3) Under QUALITY OF SERVICE,**Disable** the Enable Quality of Service High Packet Priority option.

 If changing the setting didn’t resolve the issue for you, try the next fix.

### 4\. Use a VPN

 A VPN, also known as a Virtual Private Network, can help improve your ping and thus fix packet loss issues, especially when your network is throttled by your ISP.

 A good VPN encrypts your data and redirects it through a protected tunnel. In this way, your ISP won’t be able to tell what kind of traffic you’re sending or receiving, and thus can’t interfere with your network. Your packet loss issue will likely be fixed in this case.

 There’re many VPN services available to choose from, but not every one of them is made equal. First, you may want to go for a paid VPN service instead of a free one as free VPNs come with hidden costs – ad tracking, slow connections, etc.

 If you want a trustworthy service, we recommend [**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , but if you’re looking to save money, you may want to try **[Surfshark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr.brandreward.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dc843bd9262a7db4767485d787d9c2653%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com%252F%26id%3Ddrivereasy-en-151512)**  , which only costs less than $2.5 a month.

### 5\. Try the web version

 If you’re running into this issue when running the Discord web version, you can try the Discord web version instead.

 1) Go to[discord.com](https://discord.com/) .

 2) Select Open**Discord in your browser** .

 If the packet loss issue persists in the web version, the problem could be with Discord itself. You may want to[check Discord’s status](https://discordstatus.com/) to see if any of its servers is down.

### 6\. Reinstall Discord

 If you’re running into the packet loss problem when using the desktop version of Discord, it could be an issue with installation files. Try reinstalling Discord:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

 2) Enter**%appdata%** and press**Enter** .

 10)[Download Discord](https://discord.com/) and install it on your computer.

### 7\. Update your network adapter driver

 Although it’s rare, network issues could happen when your network adapter driver is outdated or corrupted. So you want to make sure that your network driver is updated.

**You can manually** **check the driver for your network adapter** by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 **If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .** Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-57-32.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update button** next to the network driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
