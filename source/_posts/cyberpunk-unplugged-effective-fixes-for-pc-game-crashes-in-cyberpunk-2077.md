## Mastering WoW Stability: Effective Remedies for Eliminating Game Crashes in No Time

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b4d2c4a74.jpg)

 Word of Warcraft (**WOW** )**keeps crashing** in your computer, and sometimes with a black screen? Don’t panic! You can fix the crashing issues on WOW.

**Why does WoW crash on my PC** ? Usually if your WOW application is outdated, it’ll cause buggy issues like crashing or freezing. And your computer overheating can also lead to your computer freezing and so your game crashes. In addition, some problems in your system like your graphics card issue is usually one of the reasons. But don’t worry. You can do something to fix WOW crashing issues.

## How to Fix WOW crashing?

 Here are some solutions that have helped people resolve the same problem. You don’t need to try them all; just work your way down the list until your game works again.

1. **[Install the latest patch](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Run Scan and Repair for your game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Disable DVR app in Xbox](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Note: the screenshots below come from Windows 10, and fixes apply to Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### Fix 1: Install the latest patch

 Since many technical problems can be resolved by restarting, it never hurts to restart your computer and your game. Often this will be enough to fix the error.

 Game developers always keep releasing patches to improve their games and fix any issues, so you should manually check for updates of your game. Then install the latest patch to keep it up to date. This can fix some issues like WOW crashing.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 A graphics card driver corruption in your computer can also cause your game crashing. So you should update the graphics card driver to the latest version to fix the issue,

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website, find your graphics card driver and download the latest version. Then manually install it in your computer. Be sure to download the one that is compatible with your Windows OS. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.

### Fix 4: Disable DVR app in Xbox

 Windows automatically enables DVR in Xbox app, but sometimes this is incompatible with games running in your computer. So you can disable DVR in Xbox, so World of Warcraft stops crashing.

Here’s what you can do:

**If you’re using Windows 10 Build 14393 and earlier:**

1. Search**Xbox** from the search box on your desktop, and click**Xbox** to open it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b3940d874.jpg)
2. You’ll need to log into your Microsoft account if it’s the first time you open it. If that’s the case, enter your Microsoft account to log in.
3. Click the**Gear** button on the left to open**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b3bdbf4aa.jpg)
4. Click the**Game DVR** tab, and turn it**off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b3e5954b9.png)
5. Restart your computer and open World of Warcraft to see if it stops crashing.

 INFORMATION: If you don’t use Xbox in your computer, try uninstalling Xbox application to run your game properly.

**If you’re using Window 10 later than Build 14393:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** to open **Settings** .
2. Click the**Gaming** section.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8fab18ae4d5.jpg)
3. Click**Game DVR** on the left, and make sure to turn off**Record** **in the background while I’m playing a game** .
