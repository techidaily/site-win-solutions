### Then, update your graphics card driver and HP monitor driver

You can choose to update your device drivers through**Device Manager**to let Windows detect and install the updates automatically. But Microsoft can’t not always detect the update for your device drivers. Instead, you can **manually download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website**.**Alternatively**, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver and monitor driver manually, you can do it **automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. See how:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b874f241989c.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the**Pro version** which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)**Note:** You can also do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b890b1f40fe3.jpg)
