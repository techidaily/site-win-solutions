_Halo 3 Minimum System Requirements_

 If your computer meets these requirements but still Halo 3 doesn’t launch properly, try the methods below.

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

## Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 Your game might suddenly close without giving you any error message. If you’re experiencing this kind of issue even after updating the graphics drivers, then we suggest you try performing Clean Boot. It can be a great way to troubleshoot the Halo 3 crashing issues.

To do so:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

![msconfig open task manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig.jpg)

 3) Select the**Services** tab.  
 Then click**Hide all Microsoft services** and click**Disable all** .

![hide all Microsoft services; disable all](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perform-a-clean-boot-1.jpg)

 4) In the same window, select the**Startup** tab and then click**Open Task Manager** .  
  
![open task manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perform-a-clean-boot-2-1.jpg)

 5) Under the**Startup** tab in the Task Manager window, right-click on each**Enabled** Startup item, then click**Disable** . After that, close the window.  
  
![perform a clean boot; disable certain item](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perform-a-clean-boot-4-2.jpg)

![perform a clean boot](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perform-a-clean-boot-5.jpg)

7) Restart your computer and it’ll be in a clean boot environment.

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above and still haven’t resolved the Halo 3 crashing issue, then you should try running the game as an administrator.

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .  
  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
  
 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and click**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and**OK** .

 3) Go to the directory where you installed Halo 3, and run the**.exe** file as administrator as well.  
  
 4) Relaunch Halo 3.  
  
 If the problem still persists, then try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Halo 3 is available on PC through Steam. But players have been experiencing sudden crashes in Halo 3 on Steam. It can be caused by a bad game cache, so you need to ensure that the integrity of game files is intact.  
  
 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.  
  
![verify integrity of game files on Steam; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
  
 3) Right-click**Halo 3** and select**Properties** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
  
 4) Under the**LOCAL FILES** tab, click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE…** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/integrity-of-cache.png)
  
 Files verification may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, the window will automatically exit. Till then, relaunch your game.  
  
 If the issues haven’t been resolved after you tried all the methods, you can consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
