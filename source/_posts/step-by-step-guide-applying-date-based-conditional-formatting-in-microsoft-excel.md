 The second way to [create a custom conditional formatting rule](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/manipulate-sound-rate-in-youtube-playback-for-2024/) is to use the New Formatting Rule feature.

![Select Conditional Formatting, New Rule](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NewRule-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png)

##  Notes on Conditional Formatting Based on Date in Excel

 With a conditional formatting rule in place, it applies to any edits you make to the dates in the cells. For example, say you formatted dates for next week. If you change any of the dates to yesterday, the formatting automatically disappears.

![Formatting changes when dates are edited](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EditDates-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 You can set up more than one rule for the same cells. Maybe you want to see all dates this month with a red font and all those next month with a green font. You would simply follow the same steps to create each rule and adjust the formatting accordingly.
