 Conditional formatting is a terrific feature for [automatically applying highlights](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-asmr-video-insights/) or font formats to cells. If you have an Excel spreadsheet that contains dates, you can use this feature to make certain dates stand out and easy to spot.

 Whether you want to format past due dates for household bills or upcoming dates for a project plan, conditional formatting has you covered with both simple and custom options. Just set up the rule and watch your dates pop off of the sheet.

##  Create a Custom Conditional Formatting Date Rule

 Maybe you're not fond of the formatting choices available when creating the quick rule above. You can set up custom formatting instead. This allows you to [format the cells](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/1722966983711-ultimate-solution-to-get-your-epson-et-4550-up-and-running-on-windows-with-proven-techniques/) most any way you like, including using more than one format for the cells like a specific font, border, and fill color.

 You can create a custom format two ways in Excel.

###  Custom Format Method One

 The first way is to start with the same setup as above. In the pop-up window where you create the rule, use the format drop-down box to pick "Custom Format."

![Select Custom Format](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DateOccurringCustomFormat-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 When the Format Cells window opens, use the tabs at the top for Font, Border, and Fill to create your custom format. Click "OK" when you finish.

![Choose Font, Border, and Fill for the custom format](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CustomFormatFill-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 You'll see the custom format applied to the cells. Click "OK" in the small window to save the change.

###  Custom Format Method Two

 The second way to [create a custom conditional formatting rule](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/manipulate-sound-rate-in-youtube-playback-for-2024/) is to use the New Formatting Rule feature.

 Select the cells you want to format and go to the Home tab. Click the Conditional Formatting arrow and choose "New Rule."

![Select Conditional Formatting, New Rule](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NewRule-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 In the New Formatting Rule window, choose "Format Only Cells That Contain" in the Select a Rule Type section.

![Select Format Only Cells That Contain](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NewRuleCellsContain-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 At the bottom of the window, select "Dates Occurring" in the drop-down box on the left and choose the [timeframe for the date](https://change-location.techidaily.com/guide-how-to-unbrick-a-bricked-vivo-s17-pro-phone-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) to the right. Then, click "Format."

![Choose the timing for the date and click Format](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NewRuleCellsContainFormat-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 You'll see the same Format Cells box as above where you can use the Font, Border, and Fill tabs to create the custom format. When you finish, click "OK."

![Choose Font, Border, and Fill for the custom format](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CustomFormatBorder-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 The options you pick appear in the New Formatting Rule window as a preview. If you're happy with the format, click "OK" to save the rule.

![Review the new custom format rule](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NewRulePreview-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 You'll then see your cells updated with your custom format.

##  Notes on Conditional Formatting Based on Date in Excel

 With a conditional formatting rule in place, it applies to any edits you make to the dates in the cells. For example, say you formatted dates for next week. If you change any of the dates to yesterday, the formatting automatically disappears.

![Formatting changes when dates are edited](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EditDates-ExcelConditionalFormattingDates.png) 

 You can set up more than one rule for the same cells. Maybe you want to see all dates this month with a red font and all those next month with a green font. You would simply follow the same steps to create each rule and adjust the formatting accordingly.
