## Fix 3: Reinstall your drivers

 Outdated or wrong drivers could cause trouble. When you meet computer problems but have no clue to fix them, you can update related drivers for a try. Keeping your drivers updated can help you enhance device functions to improve computer performance.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-logitech-c920-webcam-not-working/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
