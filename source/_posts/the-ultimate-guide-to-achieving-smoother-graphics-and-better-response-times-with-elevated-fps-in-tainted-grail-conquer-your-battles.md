## Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the requirement

 Although Tainted Grail: Conquest isn’t as demanding as many other large games, higher PC specs will definitely boost the game performance. You can check out the**minimum system requirement** for Tainted Grail: Conquest below:

| **OS**        | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | 3.2 GHz Dual Core Processor     |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                        |
| **Graphics**  | GTX 750 2GB / equivalent Radeon |
| **Storage**   | 8 GB available space            |

 If your PC specs are sufficient for the game but you still suffer from low FPS issues, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 An outdated or faulty graphics driver can cause a lot of display issues. If you notice constant FPS drops in-game, you may want to update your graphics driver to make sure it’s functioning properly.

 One way to keep your video card driver up-to-date is to**manually update** it[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If Windows suggests your driver is up-to-date, you can still check if there’s a newer version and update it in Device Manager. Go to the manufacturer’s website, and search for the latest correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Make sure you restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. If updating the graphics driver doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patches

 The developers release patches for Tainted Grail: Conquest every now and then. And since this game had an early access release, the developers have been communicating with the players and fixing bugs upon feedback.

 When the developers are aware of a particular error that seems to cause FPS drops, you can expect an official fix from them. Even if no known issues may affect in-game FPS, you should still keep your game up-to-date to avoid other issues.

 By default, the Steam client will detect any available patches and update your game, so you don’t have to worry about missing an update. However, if you want to report a bug or any game issues, feel free to[post in their Steam forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1199030/discussions/) or[join their official discord](https://discord.com/invite/j4ejXQa) for quicker responses.

## Fix 4: Verify game files integrity

 Damaged or missing game files could cause a lot of game issues, including in-game FPS drops as well. You may want to make sure your game files are intact. Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam library and find Tainted Grail: Conquest. Right-click the game icon then click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/steam-verify-game-files%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC.jpg)
3. Steam will scan your local game files, and replace or add any corrupted or missing files to your game folder.

## Fix 5: Modify your graphics settings

 For low FPS issues, tweaking your graphics settings can usually help to some extent. You can try to:

[1. Adjust your graphics cards settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[2. Adjust in-game graphics settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Adjust your graphics card settings

[Make sure your graphics driver is up-to-date](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) before proceeding to the steps below.

**For NVIDIA graphics cards:**

1. Right-click on an empty area on your desktop, then click**NVIDIA Control Panel** .
2. On the left pane, click**3D settings** \>>**Manage 3D settings** .
3. Switch to the**Program Settings** tab.
4. Under section**1: Select a program to customize** , click**Add** . Then you need to add the game executable to the list. The default installation location for Tainted Grail: Conquest is**C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappscommon** .
5. For section**2: Select the preferred graphics processor for this program** , you can set it to**High-performance NVIDIA processor** to ensure your GPU is working at max.
6. Under section**3: Specify the settings for this program** , tweak as follows:  
   * _Image Sharpening_ :**Off**  
   * _Vertical Sync_ :**Off** (We recommend turning off V-Sync, but you can test which way brings a higher FPS as it could differ on every PC.)  
   * _Low-Latency Mode_ :**Off**  
   * _Power management mode_ :**Prefer Maximum Performance**  
   * _Threaded Optimization_ :**On**
7. Click**Apply** to save the changes. You can now test if you get a higher FPS in-game.

**For AMD graphics cards:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your desktop, then click**AMD Radeon Settings** .
2. Go to**Gaming** \>>**Global Settings** \>>**Global Graphics** , and modify the settings as follows:  
   * _Anti-aliasing Mode_ :**Use application settings**  
   * _Anti-aliasing Method_ :**Multisampling**  
   * _Texture Filtering Quality_ :**Performance**  
   * _Surface Format Optimization_ :**On**  
   * _Wait for Vertical Refresh_ :**Off, Unless Application Specifies**  
   * _Shader Cache_ :**AMD optimized**  
   * _Tessellation Mode_ :**AMD optimized**  
   * _Frame Rate Target Control_ :**Disabled**

Make sure to save the changes then test the in-game FPS.

#### Adjust in-game graphics settings

 Upon feedback, the developers are looking into known optimization issues. One workaround suggested for achieving an FPS boost is to**lower the in-game graphics settings** .

 You don’t have to modify all of them. Since the settings could bring different effects based on PC specs, it would be better to test your FPS while adjusting each graphics setting. It’s recommended for all players to lower their**resolution** and**graphics quality** , though.

 If adjusting the graphics settings fails to bring a major boost in your FPS, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Change the power plan in your graphics setting

 Windows allows the users to change the power options if needed. By setting to the high-performance mode, your CPU usage won’t be limited as it’ll be able to run at a high speed constantly.

 Note that Tainted Grail: Conquest isn’t very CPU demanding. That said, this fix will surely bring a better game performance to some extent, but may not guarantee a major FPS boost. You can still follow the steps below and try out this fix:

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**graphics** then click**Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-graphics.png)
2. Click**Browse** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browse.png)
3. Locate your game executable file and add it to the list. It’s usually in **C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappscommon** .
4. Once the exe. file is added to the list, click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/options.png)
5. Select**High Performance** , then click**Save** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/high-performance.png)

 Check if you get a higher FPS in-game now. If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Keep your system up-to-date

 Every now and then, Windows releases updates. It’s always a good idea to install the available updates, so you can make sure your PC has the necessary functions for the game. Although it may not address the low FPS issues directly, it will help prevent compatibility issues with the game which could affect the in-game FPS. Here’s how to check for available updates and how to install them:

1. In the search bar on your taskbar, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you should find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)  
 If there are available updates, click**Install updates** .
3. Restart your PC to let the updates take effect.
