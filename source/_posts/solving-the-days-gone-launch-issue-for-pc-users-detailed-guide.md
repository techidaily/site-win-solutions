 Run the game again to check if your problem gets fixed. If not, continue to the third method.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Gaming issues like Immortals Fenyx Rising not launching may indicate you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix it and improve the game performance, you need to install the latest graphics driver.

There are mainly two ways you can do this:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent correct driver from the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then install it manually. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your monitor driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). You can also click the**Update** button do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
