### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 If rolling back the graphics driver doesn’t help, it’s likely that your device drivers are faulty or outdated. To fix the constant FIFA 21 crashes and avoid other potential gaming issues, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 You may have set high in-game settings for a better visual effect and gaming experience, but if your computer is not powerful enough to cope with that, FIFA 21 will crash. You can try the following lower settings:

**1)** Launch FIFA 21 and click**Game Settings** from the menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_17-32-34.jpg)
