### Fix 1: Meet the minimum system specs

 If you can’t launch**Team Fortress 2** at all, it’s very likely that your computer doesn’t meet the game’s minimum requirements.

**Here are the minimum requirements to play TF2:**

| **OS:**        | Windows 7/Vista/XP          |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | 1.7 GHz Processor or better |
| **Memory:**    | 512 MB RAM                  |
| **Storage:**   | 15 GB available space       |

 To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below to**check your computer specifications** :

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_16-50-35.jpg)

Make sure your PC meets the requirements, then move on to the fix below.

### Fix 2: Close background programs

Overloading is one of the most common causes of game crashing issues.

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time, that can slow down your computer and cause it to overload. In this case, try closing unnecessary programs to see if that fixes your issue. Here’s how:

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-35-01-1.jpg)

**2)** Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what processes are consuming your resources most.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-35-08-1.jpg)

**3)**  Right-click the resource-consuming process and select **End task** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

**4)** Launch Team Fortress 2 again to see if it still crashes.

If the problem persists, try fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Game issues, such as game crashing, lagging, and low FPS, may occur when you’re using an incompatible graphics driver. Try updating your graphics driver to the latest version to see if it fixes your issue.

There are two ways you can get the latest correct driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/2019-tips-team-fortress-2-crash/#c2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer support website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-05-25.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-05-43.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**4)** Launch TF2 to see if it works now.

If not, try the solution below.

### Fix 7: Run TF2 in compatibility mode

**1)** Right-click the Steam icon, then select **Open file location** .
