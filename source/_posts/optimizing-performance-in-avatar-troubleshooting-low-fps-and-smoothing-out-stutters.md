 If a system restart doesn’t help and you’ve confirmed that your PC is perfectly capable of running Dead Space, you can try these fixes.

1. **[Temporarily disable firewall and antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Close conflicting or non-essential programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Temporarily disable firewall and antivirus software

 To protect our computer from malware, most of us will turn on Windows Firewall and install some antivirus software. However, there are some circumstances where they mistakenly block legitimate programs like Dead Space. To determine the cause of your problem, you can try**turning Windows Defender Firewall off** and disable your antivirus when launching Dead Space.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.  

![disable windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/temporarily-disable-firewall.png)
3. Click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .

4. Select **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)**  for Domain network, Private Network and Public network. Then click **OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You should also try disabling your antivirus if you’re using any. After you’ve done these, attempt to launch the game. If it still fails to launch or triggers any errors, proceed to the next fix. Prior to getting started with the troubleshooting steps below, remember to repeat the similar steps as listed above to turn on the Firewall and enable antivirus to protect your computer from the risk of malicious programs.

## 2\. Close conflicting or non-essential programs

 Not often, but possible, certain programs on your computer are in conflict with your game title. Besides, Dead Space Remake is graphics demanding, which requires your system to allocate sufficient resources in order to function properly. If you have too many programs running in the background while launching Dead Space, however, you’re more likely to suffer from any sort of issue. To prevent this from affecting your gameplay, you should take the steps as follows to stop certain programs from running.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **taskmgr**  and hit Enter.

## 3\. Run your game as an administrator

 Sometimes a program may not launch because it lacks the administrative rights. To rule out the cause of your issue, try to run Dead Space as an administrator. All you have to do is:

1. Go to the game’s installation folder and locate the .exe file.
2. Right-click it and select**Properties** .
3. When the Properties window opens, select the**Compatibility** tab. Then check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.

 Till now, launch the game to test if it works. If this method doesn’t give you any luck, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Download & install all Windows updates

 Windows updates are released on a regular basis to provide users with bug fixes and new features. So you should make sure they are installed in your system to get all the performance enhancements. If your issue is triggered by the incompatibilities, updating Windows is more likely to help.

1. In the Search box, type **check for updates** . Then click **Check for updates**  from the list of results.  

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)
2. Click on the **Check for updates**  button. If updates are available, follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the updates for your system.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)

 After the updates are installed, reboot your device and then try to launch your game. If you’re still having the issue, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is one of the core components of your computer. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU. Unfortunately, it’s also susceptible to corruption. When that happens, your PC performance would suffer and your graphics-intensive game may fail to work properly. Therefore, it’s imperative to update your graphics driver. Additionally, when a new title comes out, some graphics card manufacturers would release game-ready drivers, which you should definitely download and install.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Manually update your drivers

 If you have the time, patience and computer skills to update drivers on your own, you can visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.in/Download/index.aspx)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the most up-to-date driver and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install it for your system.

## 6\. Verify your game files

 From time to time, game files can get corrupted and some important ones may even be missing, causing the issue of your game failing to launch as expected. To replace the corrupted files and make sure they are intact, you should try to verify them within the gaming platform.

### On Steam

1. Open your Steam client. Under**LIBRARY** , right-click your game title and select**Properties** .
2. Choose the **LOCAL FILES**  tab. Then click on the **Verify integrity of game files…**  button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dead-Space-verify-intergrity-of-game-files-on-Steam.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now Steam will start scanning your game files. This process may take a few minutes. If there are file validation failures, you can safely ignore the message that pops up.

 When the verification process is finished, close the window and check if it solves your problem. If your game still fails to launch, move on to the next fix.

### On EA

1. Open the EA desktop app.
2. Click**My Collection** . Locate your game and click on the**three dots** . Then select**Repair** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dead-Space-Remake-repair-game-files-on-the-EA-app.png)

 Then all you have to do is wait until the repair process is complete. If this doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dead-Space-Remake-repair-game-files-on-the-Epic-Games-Launcher.png)
2. Now click on the**VERIFY** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Depending on the size of your game, it may take a few minutes to verify all your files. Once it finishes, try to launch your game to check whether verifying game files works.

## 7\. Repair corrupted system files

 If you’ve exhausted all the methods above but still haven’t managed to solve your problem, it’s time to identify whether it’s due to the corruption of your system files, which can cause a wide range of issues, ranging from minor glitches to critical performance issues. To make sure those files are intact, you can use the**System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .

5. Now type **sfc /scannow**  and press Enter. Then it’ll start scanning the integrity of all protected operating system files and replace incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions.  

 When you see a message that says “Verification 100% complete”, type **exit** and press Enter.
