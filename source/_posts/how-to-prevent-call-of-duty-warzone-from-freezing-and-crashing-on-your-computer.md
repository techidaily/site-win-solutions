<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy again and check if this fix works. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## 5\. Disable overlays

 Overlays are handy. However, sometimes they would interfere with the game and even block the game files.

 If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling Steam Overlay for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Nvidia GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, etc.), make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature.

 Run the game and see if it crashes again. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## 6\. Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Many 3rd party antivirus software often blocks important game files. Once some important game files are blocked, the game would crash.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.
