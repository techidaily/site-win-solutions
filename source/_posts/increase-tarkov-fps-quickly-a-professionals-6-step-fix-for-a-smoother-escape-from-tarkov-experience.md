### Fix 1 â€“ Restart your computer

 A refresh restart will reset the software and desktop environment and can often fix software glitches like this.

 So if you havenâ€™t done this yet, give it a shot. A simple restart may be all you need to solve Roblox or Roblox Studio-related issues.

### Fix 2 â€“ Try an alternative browser

 Roblox is compatible with all leading browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and more. To make sure Roblox works well on your device, make sure youâ€™re using the latest version of the browser.

 If youâ€™re still unable to get into a Roblox game from your current browser, try a different one to see if it works. For example, if you canâ€™t launch your Roblox game from Chrome, try opening Firefox and launch the game.

 If Roblox wonâ€™t load the game from any browser, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 3 â€“ Reset your Internet Options

 Youâ€™ll need to open Internet Explorer to perform the following steps, but this will fix problems even if you use other browsers, such as Chrome, to play the game.

**1)**  Run **Internet Explorer** .

**2)** Click the **gear button** on the top-right corner of your screen, then click **Internet options** .

### Fix 4 â€“ Disable your ad-blocker/extensions

### Fix 5 â€“ Check your Firewall

 As with all multiplayer games, Roblox requires an internet connection to send and receive data.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time.

**9)**  Firewall will prompt you to allow access to networks, click **Allow access** .

If you still canâ€™t join the game, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 6 â€“ Temporarily close your anti-virus

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if thatâ€™s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and firewall and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 9 â€“ Update your device driver

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update or use a trusted third-party product, itâ€™s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
