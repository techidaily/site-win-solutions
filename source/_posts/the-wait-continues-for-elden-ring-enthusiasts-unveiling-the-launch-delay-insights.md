2. **Right-click** on **Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy** and select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 Launch Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy after the verifying process is complete. See if it crashes again.

If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 Run the game and see if it crashes again. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## 6\. Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Many 3rd party antivirus software often blocks important game files. Once some important game files are blocked, the game would crash.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.
