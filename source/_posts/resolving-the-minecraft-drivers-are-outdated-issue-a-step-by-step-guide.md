### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 A missing or outdated driver may also trigger the game crashing issue. If it’s the case, this issue can be easily resolved after you update your drivers.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest drivers for your computer.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact PC model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
