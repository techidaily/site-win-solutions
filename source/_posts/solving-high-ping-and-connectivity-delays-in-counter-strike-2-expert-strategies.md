## Are You Experiencing Connectivity Issues on Xbox Live? Find Server Updates Here

**Cannot sign in or play any games (not even offline games) on Xbox Live** ? This is both frustrating and confusing. You may be wondering if the error is on your end or is everybody else is suffering the outage. So, is**Xbox Live Down or not** ? Read on and youâ€™ll have your answerâ€¦

## Is Xbox Live Down?

 Here are 3 methods for you to determine if itâ€™s an Xbox Live down problem. Just work your way down until you find it out.

1. [**Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Check Xbox Server Status**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Look up the error messages or codes**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network

 When you have a connection issue on Xbox Live, it is important to check **whether your Xbox One console or PC (if youâ€™re using Xbox app on your computer) is the only device with no Internet connection** .

 To do so, simply check other devices (your phone, tablet, TV set) to see if theyâ€™re online properly.

* **If these devices cannot connect to the Internet either** , then obviously the problem does not lie with your Xbox or PC. You can either do some basic troubleshooting on your modem by yourself (such as performing a reboot on your modem) or contact your ISP for assistance to fix the issues with your network.
* **If these devices can access the Internet properl** y, then you should move on to**Method 2** , below to narrow down the problem.

### Method 2: Check Xbox Server Status

 With home network issues ruled out, you might want to check if itâ€™s a service server outage or not. To do so, simple go to the official[**Xbox Live Status**](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) . From there, youâ€™ll see the status information of Xbox services, games, websites and apps.

* **A green check icon** indicates that the server is working properly. If you still have trouble connecting to Xbox One, you might have to jump to Method 3 to locate the culprit.
* **A red exclamation mark** means the server is currently down. You can also read the on-screen information to know more about the outage and the affected platforms. Often, there is a**Notify me** option you can choose to get instantly notified by an email when the service is back online again.

### Method 3: Look up the error messages or codes

 Now that youâ€™ve confirmed neither your home network or the server is to blame, the error is probably on your end. You can start by checking your Xbox screen for error to see if there is any error message or code on the screen. If you see an error code or message, head to[**Xbox One Error & Status Code Search**](https://support.xbox.com/en-HK/error-code-lookup) and enter the exact same message or code as shown.

## Bonus tip: Xbox Live still not working on my PC?

 If youâ€™ve exhausted all the fixes lain out on Xbox Support, but the Xbox One not working issue is still not resolved, then itâ€™s time to check if itâ€™s a driver issue on your computer. As a wrong or outdated network driver may cause slow Internet connection, Internet keeps cutting out or even app not connecting to Internet problems.
