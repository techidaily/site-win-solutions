 Relaunch FUSER after the verifying process completed to see if this fix works. If not, don’t worry. Just move on and try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The developer of FUSER releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run FUSER again to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Turn off VSync

 VSync, or vertical synchronization, is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game with a monitor’s refresh rate. If your PC is suffering from screen tearing, enabling VSync can be an effective fix.

 However, Some PC gamers reported that the VSync feature may interfere with FUSER and may cause the game to crash.

You can try turning off VSync and see if this issue persists.

 To turn off VSync in Nvidia graphics card, just open**Nvidia Control Panel** , then go to**Manage 3D Settings** \>**Program Settings** , then add**FUSER** . Scroll down to set**VSync** to**OFF** .

 Launch the game and see if this fix works. If the game still crashes, just try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: perform a clean boot

 You may need to **perform a clean boot**  if the FUSER crashing issue persists.

 The clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to manually disable startups and services so that you can **find out the problematic program that crashes the game** . Once you locate the program, just uninstall it, and then the this issue will be solved. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
