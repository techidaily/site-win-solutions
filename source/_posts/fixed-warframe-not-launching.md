Still no luck? Move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Allow your game through Controlled Folder Access and antivirus

 It’s also possible that Windows Security and other antivirus have prevented Monter Hunter Rise from running, and therefore the game fails to launch. To tweak the settings, follow the steps below:

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game bugs or not launching is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . A driver update can tackle compatibility issues of new games like Monster Hunter Rise and offer a zero-cost performance boost. So before you try anything more complicated, check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 You can update the GPU driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and downloading the latest driver corresponding with your system. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
