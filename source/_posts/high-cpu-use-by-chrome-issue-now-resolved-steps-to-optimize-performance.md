 After this, restart your computer to make sure it’s applied. Then test your gameplay. If disabling hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling doesn’t make any difference, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Delete the cache for the game

 Some players reported on Reddit that deleting the game cache helped them reduce the in-game stutters. So you can give it a try and see how it works.

 For some reason, settings by default may not always give you the best result. To make sure you can enjoy Battlefield 2042 to the fullest on your own computer, adjust the following in-game settings:

* Future frame rendering:**OFF**
* Vertical sync:**OFF**
