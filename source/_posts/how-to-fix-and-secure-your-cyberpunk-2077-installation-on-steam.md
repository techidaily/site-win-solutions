## Cyberpunk 2077 Steam Installation Problems? Here's How to Overcome Them

**[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/cyberpunk-2077?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=77f2b98e2cef40c8a7437518bf420e47)**  is finally out! Players can’t wait to add it to their game list. But the issue you might be encountering is, the download on Steam is stuck at 57.4 GB or the download speed is super slow. In this article, we’ll guide you how to fix it.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Uncheck bonus content under DLC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Change Steam download server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Set Steam’s priority to High](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update network adapter driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Clear download cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Set a bandwidth limit](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Uncheck bonus content under DLC

 If your Cyberpunk download is stuck on 57.4 GB, it probably is extracting the game files. This happens with preloaded games on Steam. So you just need a little more patience and you’ll be in. However, if you can’t wait for any longer, disabling the DLC content download may help you.

 1) Under the**LIBRARY** tab, navigate to your game**Cyberpunk 2077** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-on-Properties-on-Steam.jpg)

 2) Select the tab**DLC** . Then uncheck the box**Cyberpunk 2077 Bonus Content** . (If the DLC portion isn’t popping up for you, try restarting your computer and after that, try to log in to your Steam account.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DLC-uncheck-install.jpg)

 Once done, you should be able to fix the game stuck at 57.4/64 GB issue. If this didn’t work for you, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Change Steam download server

 When there are so many players downloading the game, servers might be overloaded. Changing Steam download server can help you fix it. Here are the steps you can take:

 1) From your Steam Client, open the Settings panel by selecting**Steam** \>**Settings** from the top left client menu.  
  
![change the Steam download server location](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location.jpg)

 2) In the Settings panel, select the**Downloads** tab. Then in the**Download Region** section, choose another download region in the drop-down menu. According to the tests, Asian servers can substantially increase your download speed. It’s probably because there’s less traffic congestion.  
  
![change Steam download server](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location-donwnload-region.jpg)
  
 After applying the changes, resume your download to check if this boosts your download speed.

 You can also check[Steam Download Stats](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/) to avoid the high traffic.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open Task Manager.

 3) You’re directed to the**Details** tab and**steam.exe** will be highlighted. Right-click it and select**Set priority > High** .  
  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067" border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

## Fix 4: Update network adapter driver

 Whether you have a slow download speed or you’re stuck at downloading, it could be an issue related to your network connection. And your outdated network adapter driver can be the culprit. To fix it, you’re supposed to update your network adapter driver, especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated it.

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how it works:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![update network adapter driver automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

## Fix 5: Clear download cache

 Clearing your download cache can solve problems with game’s slow download speed or other download issues. This process will not affect your currently installed games, but you’ll need to log into Steam afterwards. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) From your Steam Client, open the Settings panel by selecting**Steam** \>**Settings** from the top left client menu.
